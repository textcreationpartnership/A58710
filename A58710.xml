            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>PRovidence over-rules all Things: but never any Act of Providence, ſo ſtrange and ſo ſurprizing, as the great Revolution that ſo lately happened in the two Kingdoms, of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> A Revolution not to be parallel'd in Hiſtory, but ſeaſonable to the Britiſh Monarchy, the Glory whereof was almoſt brought to Ruine and Deſtruction. Nor was it to be admired that the deſire of ſuch a Change ſhould reach ſo far as <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the cauſes were the ſame, and the cries of Oppreſſions were no leſs loud then in <hi>England.</hi> For it is too evident that all the Laws, Priviledges and Rights of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> had under the late Raigns, been not onely encroached upon, but subverted and Overthrown. In regard that by the gradual enlargements of the Prerogative, beyond what was allow'd by
<pb facs="tcp:64970:4"/>the Laws of the Conſtitution, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Realm, the Legal and Regular Monarchy of the Nation, was ſwell'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Arbitrary and Deſpotic Power. So that all the Franchiſes and Rights, which by Original Contracts and Subſequent Laws were reſerved unto the People, were either overthrown or precariouſly enjoy'd.</p>
            <p>No wonder then it was, that as well the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſought for ſpeedy Redreſs, and to be freed as well from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bondage as Temporal Slavery. Which at length they obtained by the auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Conduct, and Generous Advance of his Preſent Majesty to their Relief. A Story certainly that cannot be otherwiſe then moſt grateful to Poſterity, as being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch Variety of circumſtances, ſuch unparallel'd Succeſs, and the General Advantage of all <hi>Europe.</hi> It was no eaſie Thing to reduce into Order a Chaos of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo diſmally mangled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, which being ſo great a Work and brought to ſo much Perfection in ſo ſhort a Time, as it ſhews the Extraordinary Zeal and Prudence of the Artificers; ſo did it no leſs magnifie the Influences that govern'd and directed all their Actions. Inſomuch
<pb facs="tcp:64970:4"/>that it may be ſaid of the Moſt Illuſtrious King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> what <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſays of the Famous and Beſt of the Roman Emperours <hi>Veſpaſian; Rebellione Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Principum et caede incertum, et qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri vagum Imperium, ſuſcepit firmavitque Gens Naſſovia.</hi> Popery and Idolatry now droop, and the Proteſtant Religion enjoys a general Freedom under a truly Proteſtant Defender. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious Government ſoon might theſe two Nations be happy, had we not ſo many <hi>Diſturbers</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> amongſt us, though it was not well known what they repined and grumbled at, till this late detection of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Conſpiracy for the Reſtoration of Popery and Tyranny.</p>
            <p>In ſhort there has already an accompt been given of our deliverance in <hi>England;</hi> This is a Proſpect of the ſame Deliverance in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the one no leſs conducible to be known then the Other: eſpecially to thoſe who are deſirous to obſerve the Coherences and Concatenations of Providence.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay it is a structure embelliſhed with the flouriſhes of Eloquence, as being only deſigned for plainneſs and exactneſs; wherein I may he bold to ſay that diligence
<pb facs="tcp:64970:5"/>has been obſerved, as to compile it in the beſt manner and method, that the Truth of Collection could any way claim as due to it. And being laid upon ſo ſolid a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however it fares of it ſelf, it may ſerve to give Light to politer Pens, when they ſhall be at leiſure to be more accurate. Though there is no queſtion to be made, but that many will be as willing to ſee the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Raſters of a Hiſtory, as to view the covered Frame, though Japanned over never ſo curiouſly.</p>

            <head>The Hiſtory of the Affairs, and late Revolution in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> from the Year <hi>1660.</hi> to this preſent Year <hi>1690.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Charles</hi> II. was reſtored in the Year 1660. to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Dominions, from which he had been for ſome time kept out by the Civil Wars, the Joy was no leſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and univerſal in <hi>Scotland</hi> then in <hi>England:</hi> And it may be ſaid, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary favour of Heaven did ſo ſecond the Conſtancy of the Scottiſh Nation's Love to a Prince ſo long wiſh'd for, that their great Perſuaſions of his ſingular Endowments, without regard to the wary Cautions of ſcrupulous Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, were the only meaſures of their Conceſſions. They eſtabliſhed his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to be abſolute and uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the choice of all Officers of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64970:6"/>State, Counſellors and Judges; and in and over all matters of Peace, War, Leagues, Conventions and Parliaments, with a diſtinct Excluſion of all Exceptions. They added to his Revenue above double of what he formerly poſſeſſed. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his ordering and diſpoſal of Trade with Foreign Nations, and the laying Reſtraints and Impoſitions upon Foreign Imported Commodities, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his Majeſty and his Succeſſors, as an undoubted Prerogative of the Crown. And that it might appear that they placed the Security of all their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts more in the confidence of His Majeſties Goodneſs, than on the firmeſt proviſion of their beſt Laws; tho' the Parliament in 1641. was held by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. then preſent in perſon, and many Acts were there paſs'd, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by him, for the ſetling their Religion and Liberties with all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Judgment, that long and well-weigh'd Experience could furniſh; yet becauſe their Luſter ſeemed to be ſomewhat eclipſed by the harſh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſome previous Contentions, wherein it was their misfortune to have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64970:6"/>His Majeſty differing from them, at one blow they annull'd that Parliament, and without any other reaſon or diſtinction, reſcinded all its Proceedings. Laſtly, to teſtifie their unparallel'd Submiſſion and Reſignation to the King's Pleaſure, and how that, according to the uſual Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of thoſe times, all that was dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to them was to him ſurrendred; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Nation, ſince its firſt reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Popery, had in a manner continually oppos'd Prelacy; and after having ejected it with the moſt rigid Excluſions, had for many years enjoyed a Church Conſtitution and Miniſtry, which at laſt was highly commendable, for the advancing of true Knowledge and Piety, and in the worſt of Times appeared the faireſt Bulwark of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, yet out of compliance to the King's Will, the Parliament conſented, and the People ſilently acquieſced in the unexpected overthrow of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> and the re-eſtabliſhment of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy;</hi> not that the conſequences of the Alteration, which afterward enſu'd, were unforeſeen; but in ſhort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that to a King ſo acceptable to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64970:7"/>them, and to whom they had already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all things, they could refuſe nothing.</p>
            <p>This was the Poſture of Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſoon after the Reſtauration of <hi>Charles</hi> II. at what time the Earl of <hi>M.</hi> was the firſt who was honoured with the King's Commiſſion, wherein he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred himſelf with extraordinary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; but over-haſtning, as the Cauſe is given, and over-prizing his Work, he render'd himſelf at length obnoxious; ſo that upon the mutual Jealouſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke, tho then but Earl of <hi>L.</hi> whom he caus'd to be ſentenc'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of publick Truſt, <hi>L.</hi> got the Advantage, and managing it perſonally at Court, by a crafty inſinuation of the Earl of <hi>M</hi>'s Diſdain of his unworthy Practices, which perhaps at that time were thought good Services at Court, in a ſhort time prevailed to <hi>M</hi>'s Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw; and ſhaping a courſe leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Envy, obtain'd his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be given to the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> whom <hi>L.</hi> accompanied from Court into <hi>Scotland,</hi> in order to concluding the Parliament then ſitting.</p>
            <p>In the laſt Seſſions of which Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64970:7"/>it was, that by <hi>L</hi>'s Induſtry, an humble Tender was made of Twenty Thouſand Foot and Two Thouſand Horſe, to be in readineſs as they ſhould be call'd for by the King, to march to any part of his Dominions of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> for the ſuppreſſing of any Foreign Invaſion, Inteſtin Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Inſurrection, or for any other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice wherein the King's Honour, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Greatneſs might be concern'd; which though it were look'd upon as too ſuperfluous in the Expreſſion, and too ſuſpitious in the Diſtinctions; yet ſuch was the Style and Humour of thoſe times, as eaſily ſhrowded it from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice. But what <hi>L.</hi> who was the chief Contriver of it, intended by it, ſucceeding time ſufficiently diſcover'd.</p>
            <p>For now the Parliament being Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, the new-erected Biſhops, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves ſo numerouſly guarded, and Authoriz'd by the Laws ſo lately made, drave on like <hi>Jehu</hi>'s, during the years 64, 65, and 66. inforcing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity at ſuch a rate, that in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, had not the Earl of <hi>Twedale</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Murray</hi> ſtept in for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64970:8"/>Relief of the oppreſſed Diſſenters, the whole Kingdom might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to great extremities, through the Tumults excited and Tragedies act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe years.</p>
            <p>In the year 1669. <hi>L.</hi> himſelf was made the King's Commiſſioner, a Grandeur which he had long aim'd at, from the Date of which Commiſſion the <hi>Scots</hi> are ſaid to calculate the date of all the enſuing miſchiefs that caus'd the ſame Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that Kingdom, as in <hi>England:</hi> For having undertaken to make the King's Power Abſolute and Arbitrary in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he ſtrain'd the Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to all the Exceſſes imaginable. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he aſſum'd to himſelf a lawleſs Adminiſtration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which no doubt was readily granted him to exerciſe, upon the large Promiſes he had made; and apprehending more the controul of other Men's Officious med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, then diſtruſting his own Abilities, he took particular care and caution to make himſelf his Majeſties <hi>Sole Informer,</hi> as well as his <hi>Sole Secretary;</hi> and by that means, not only upon pretence of the King's Prerogative, the Affairs of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64970:8"/>were diſpos'd of in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> without any notice taken of the King's Council in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but ſtrict Obſervation was alſo made of all Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhmen that came to the Engliſh Court; and to attempt an Addseſs, or Acceſs to his Majeſty, otherwiſe then by <hi>L</hi>'s means, was to hazard his perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. By theſe ways he made himſelf the only ſignificant perſon of the whole Scottiſh Nation; and in <hi>Scotland</hi> it ſelf procured to himſelf that Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as to name the Privy Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, to place and remove the Lords of the Seſſion and Exchequer, to grant Gifts and Penſions, to levy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Armies, to appoint General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and to tranſact all matters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as he thought good to adviſe and direct. Nor was he leſs induſtrious in minding his own Buſineſs, which was to inrich Himſelf, his Kindred and Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; and where the Law gave any ſtop, the Kings Prerogative made way. In all which, as there is a neceſſity to make uſe of Force and Violence, to which Law muſt of neceſſity yield, thoſe breaches of the Law were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64970:9"/>with moſt violent Oppreſſions of the People, Monopolies and Rapes upon their Priviledges, and other dreadful Miſeries, the Concomitants of Tyrannic Rule; which occaſioning loud Complaints without redreſs, drive the Oppreſſed to Inſurrection and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; many times wiſh'd for by ſome Tyrants that they may have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to deſtroy. Inſomuch that the Rebellion which was quell'd at <hi>Bothwel</hi>-Bridge, was deem'd to be a piece of <hi>L</hi>'s Matchiavilianiſm, having by his cruel Oppreſſions of thoſe People, drawn them to ſeek their own Redreſs, to the end they might be ruin'd by their ill Succeſs; which the ſeverity of their Perſecution after the Defeat ſufficiently juſtified.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, The chiefeſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Glories of <hi>L</hi>'s Adminiſtration, as they were repreſented to the King, were, Ignorant and inſufficient Judges, for the moſt part a light and baſe Coyn impoſed upon the Nation, Gifts of Wards and Marriages, General Gifts of the Pains of Penal Statutes, the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of Great Offices upon ſingle
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64970:9"/>Perſons, and thoſe of no Merit, Gifts of the Reverſions of Offices, Invaſions upon Liberty and Property by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of private Letters; unneceſſary, long and frequent Adjournments of Parliament, miſmanagement and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Revenue, and the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive greatneſs of a State-Miniſter, to the excluſion of all others from free Application to the King; by ſome of which he did the Kings, by others his own and his Friends Buſineſs, tho the People ſuffered all this while.</p>
            <p>But that which <hi>L.</hi> moſt valu'd himſelf upon, was his obtaining a Confirmation of the Kings Supremacy over all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in all Cauſes within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and by vertue of that Act, the ordering of the External Government and Policy of the Church, as properly belonging to him and his Succeſſors; and the procuring a new Act of Militia, ordaining that all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhould be therein enroll'd, ſhould be particularly reſerv'd for that Employment; and that the Officers and Souldiers ſhould take the Oaths of Allegiance, which in <hi>Scotland</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64970:10"/>that of Supremacy; Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done in the Year 1672. when the Cabal at Court for the advancement of Popery and Arbitrary Power was in its Aſcendent, and Matters were come to a manifeſt Criſis, was a ſhrewd Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>L.</hi> was deep in the Plot.</p>
            <p>Nor was his Adminiſtration in Church Affairs leſs grievous and terrible to the Nation. For that after the extream Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, where into the Epiſcopal Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions had brought the Country, had mov'd the Compaſſion of ſome more moderate Perſons to obtain for it the eaſe of a ſmall Indulgence in 1669. <hi>L.</hi> in 1670. commands Conformity again, prohibiting Praying to God in any Meeting, or Preaching without Licence under Forfeitures of Life and Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goods: And by other Acts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning all the Kings Subjects to keep to their own Churches, and to make diſcoveries upon Oath of what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles they knew, and what Words they heard ſpoken therein, under the pains of Baniſhment and Impriſonment. All which the People lookt upon to be a Tyranny beyond that of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64970:10"/>
            <p>Nor is it in the laſt place to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he had alſo enlarg'd the Power of the Lords of the Articles, to the ſubverſion of the Rights and Priviledges of the Parliament. So that his Adminiſtration was not only Cruel and Tyrannical, but he had in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner over-turn'd the whole Frame of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Government. However, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had thus ſerv'd and aſſiſted in the Popiſh and Arbitrary Deſigns then on Foot, both to his own Infamy, and greatly to the depopulation of his Country; yet becauſe he demurr'd to act on ſtill for the eradication of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm, and erecting Popery to be the National Religion, he was diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from his Miniſtry and Offices, and grew deſpis'd and contemn'd in his Perſon.</p>
            <p>And then it was that the D. of <hi>York</hi> retiring into <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that threaten'd him in <hi>England,</hi> built upon the Foundations that <hi>L.</hi> had laid; and driving on in the concerns of Popery and Slavery with his wonted Phaetonic Fury, thought to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated his Work, but made way for the following Revolution.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64970:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>So ſoon as the Duke got into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Parliament was ſummon'd, and great Induſtry us'd to chooſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to cajole ſome of the Lords, and to make D. <hi>Hamilton</hi> believe, and truſt the Court for the future. And ſo ſoon as the Parliament ſate, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> entred as his Brothers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner without any regard to the Laws of the Realm, or the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary for taking the Oaths. However his Brothers Indulgence bore him out, and when he was in, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſucceſſion of the Crown to be confirmed by an Act, and gets a Teſt paſs'd, by which all were to ſwear, not to endeavour to alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either in Churh or State; and all ſuch as refus'd to take it, to loſe their Employments.</p>
            <p>This Teſt was generally diſlik'd, as not conformable to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith; ſeveral of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods rejected it, and many of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty refuſed it. Among the reſt the E. of <hi>Argyle</hi> declin'd the taking it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he might make his own Explanation of the ſenſe and meaning in which he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64970:11"/>took it. Which being at firſt allow'd him by the Duke and his Party, yet afterwards when he had deliver'd in his Explantion, which was no more then what the Privy Council were forc'd to do for the ſatisfaction of the People; The Duke having a particular Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to his Perſon, and reſolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him out of the way as a Grand Obſtacle to his Deſigns, caus'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to be ſcan'd and ſifted to that degree, with a particular encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to his Advocates to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it might not be wreſted to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that at length a latent piece of High-Treaſon was found in it, upon which he was Indicted, Arraign'd and Condemn'd, and had been put to death, had he not made his eſcape out of <hi>Edinborough</hi> Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Popery then began to triumph bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> to that degree, that Maſs-Houſes were publickly erected both in <hi>Edinborough,</hi> and divers other Towns and Cities of that Realm, while the Proteſtant Non-conformiſts were every where puniſhed with the utmoſt ſeverity. And ſuch was the Dukes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64970:12"/>inveterate hatred of thoſe People, that in his publick Declarations he ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd them as a ſort of Caitiffs not fit for Human Converſe; and ſcrupl'd not to teſtifie his Reſolutions to eradicate them for refuſing to conform to his Will and Pleaſure, as the Peſts of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: Affirming withal, that it would never be well with <hi>Scotland</hi> till all the Country on this ſide the <hi>Forth</hi> were made a Hunting Field. Which Rigorous, and indeed Inhuman Proceedings in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe poor People at the Mercy of his Souldiers, to be not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd in the Exerciſe of their Divine Worſhip, but to be Arraign'd and Condemn'd by Military Judges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Form or Proceſs of Law, wholly alienated the Affections of a great part of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation from his Perſon and Government. But the Duke encompaſs'd with a ſtanding Force, and encouraged by his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd Succeſs in carrying all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, thought he could meet with no Obſtruction which he could not Conquer, and therefore reſolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move what ever Impediments that he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64970:12"/>found in his way. Which run him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that no leſs Impolitick, then unjuſt and violent Proſecution of the E. of <hi>Argyle;</hi> for the taking away of whoſe Life, he could find no other pretence, but his refuſal to take an inſnaring Teſt, which the generality of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Laity refus'd: For if the whole Body of Refuſers had had but one Neck; he might have cut it off for the ſame Reaſon, as well as the ſingle Head of the Earl. Many others alſo were proſecuted and condemned at the ſame rate, for Crimes made ſuch for their Deſtruction, rather then that they were really ſo. The citing Sir <hi>John Scot</hi> of <hi>Ancrum,</hi> and bringing him before the Council upon pretence of Treaſonable Words alledg'd againſt him by an avow'd Enemy; and which had certainly done his buſineſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering he was lookt upon as a true Lover of his Country, had he not been ſo fortunate as to have four or five Perſons of great Worth and Credit by, when the Words were pretended to have been ſpoken, who clear'd and acquitted him: The ſeiſing and putting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64970:13"/>to the Torture one <hi>Hamilton,</hi> meerly becauſe he was of the contrary Party, and conſequently barely ſuſpected; who nevertheleſs after his enduring his Torments, with an extraordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, was at length acquitted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Innocent by the <hi>Juſtice Court;</hi> The putting under Bail or in Priſon almoſt all the Honeſt Proteſtant Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentlemen, or forcing them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond, or withdraw out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of whom the Lord <hi>Melvil</hi> was one, who never could be induced to act in publick under the Government of the Duke, but was forc'd to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Relations and Native Country, and flie into <hi>Holland,</hi> where, and in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> he remain'd ſeven Years; The ſending away of above ſixty Men at one time to be ſold as Slaves in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giny,</hi> for no other Crime but their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended at Conventicles; and the ordering a Veſſel at another time to be ſunk in the Sea, to the drowning of above fifty Perſons, againſt whom there was no other charge; but their Integrity to God and the Proteſtant Religion, were among others, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64970:13"/>Inſtances of Arbitrary Tyranny, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to provoke an utter deteſtation of the Authors of the farther Miſeries and Depopulations intended againſt thoſe that remained.</p>
            <p>It would be too tedious to make a Collection of the Violences and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of thoſe Times; and therefore let the following Epitome ſuffice to ſhew the wicked ways, by which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Tyranny labour to eſtabliſh themſelves. For during thoſe Years, which were the ſevereſt Years of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britrary Power that ever <hi>Scotland</hi> felt, tho Informing were a Trade then more encourag'd then in the Reign of <hi>Tybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> yet Multitudes were arraign'd without Informer or Accuſer, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever appear'd not upon Citation, were treated as Criminals.</p>
            <p>Many of all Ranks were ſeiz'd, and detain'd Months and Years, without any ſignification of the cauſe of their Impriſonment. However, if the leaſt ſhadow could be found to proſecute ſuch as miſlik'd their Arbitrary Courſes, the ruling Grandees precipitated their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64970:14"/>Proceſs, not allowing them time or means to vindicate their Innocency.</p>
            <p>Inquiſiitors were ſent to all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Citizens Houſes, to examine whom they pleas'd, upon the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate Queſtions of Church and State-Government; and if they refus'd to anſwer, or gave diſſatisfactory Anſwers, it was enough for the foundation of an Indictment. Others being ſeiz'd in the Crowd at Executions, and ſome while they were viſiting the Impriſon'd, were condemn'd and executed for refuſing to juſtifie the ſeverities of the grand Movers, and diſowning their Dagon of Non-reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Spies were frequently ſent to Priſons, Cities and Countries, who by diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling their diſſatisfaction at the Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of the Government, drew forth Words from the moſt wary, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came fit Witneſſes to take away their Lives.</p>
            <p>The Judges themſelves were active to ſuborn Witneſſes againſt the Lives, Eſtates and Honours of Worthy Peers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots; and often made uſe of Jurors and evidence, that could not purge themſelves of Prejudice and Partiality.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64970:14"/>
            <p>Many were indicted, try'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd and executed all in one day; and when interceſſion has been made for ſome time to prepare for Death, the Anſwer was, They ſhould have no time to prepare for Heaven, for that Hell was too good for them. Some they hang'd early in the Morning to prevent the Peoples obſervation of their Cruelty; and many times Drums were ordered to be beat about the Scaffold, leſt the Spectators ſhould hear the dying Words of thoſe that ſuffer'd.</p>
            <p>Some were twice ſentenc'd; firſt to have their Ears cut off, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examin'd and ſentenc'd to death.</p>
            <p>I omit their impoſing of Illegal Oaths, and packing of Juries: But what could be more perfidious, then when ſome People had made a Candid Confeſſion upon ſecurity of the publick Faith, the Kings Honour, and the Act and Oath of the Council, that ſuch their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhould not prejudice them; yet afterwards to bring the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and give it in upon Oath againſt them?</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64970:15"/>
            <p>Laſtly, Finding that Forms of Law and Tryals were too ſlow and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to bring about their Popiſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which required more haſt; and perceiving likewiſe that publick Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions tended but the more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and multiply the Lovers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Liberty, rather then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh and deter; the D. and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil found out a more compendious way of ſending out their Souldiers, who were empowr'd to challenge and examine whom they pleas'd, and to tender them Oaths which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by no Law, and to puniſh ſuch by preſent Death, who refus'd to ſwear, or refus'd to anſwer their inſnaring Queſtions; which Bloody Commiſſions were ſo faithfully executed, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few Weeks above fifty Perſons were murder'd after this manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tryal or Conviction.</p>
            <p>No wonder then, ſeeing that by ſuch Oppreſſions as theſe, the Ancient Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom were not only invaded, but an open attempt made for their utter ſubverſion, that a People exaſperated by exorbitant Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64970:15"/>and depriv'd the exerciſe of their belov'd Religion, took thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which they thought might prove moſt ſucceſsful to deliver them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from bodily Bondage, but the Thraldom of their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>Underſtanding therefore which courſe the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> ſteer'd, they thought it their beſt way to lay hold of the Opportunity, and follow the ſame. To which purpoſe as many of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> attended His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his Expedition for <hi>England;</hi> ſo there were others that met him at <hi>London,</hi> in order to make their Addreſſes to him, according to the Pattern of the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>And now the People in <hi>Scotland</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, or at leaſt full of hopes that their Deliverance was at hand, as in all ſuddain Revolutions, before there can be a ſettlement of thoſe Diſorders oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the cauſes of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſame Accidents fell out in <hi>Edinborough,</hi> as happen'd in <hi>London.</hi> It being the cuſtom of the common Sort, in thoſe Interſtitiums of Regular
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64970:16"/>Rule, to aſſume to themſelves a kind of Carnival Liberty to indulge their two Paſſions of Joy and Revenge in the General Confuſion, which is the Rabbles Holiday.</p>
            <p>Thus as in <hi>England,</hi> no ſooner had King <hi>James</hi>'s Steers-men forſook the Helm of Government, for fear of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in the Storm, but the Mobile in <hi>Edinborough</hi> enter'd upon the Stage. But the ſtreſs of their Fury fell upon the Pope and the Papiſts, which was not a little incens'd by the Students of <hi>Edinborough</hi> College, who mixing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Rabble to fortifie their Power, notwithſtanding all the care that was taken to prevent it, effected their Deſign. To which purpoſe an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies of the Pope being ready prepar'd, was brought to the Market Croſs of the City, ſo ſoon as Day-light was ſhut in, and blown up in the Air above four Stories high; which made many believe that riper Heads then thoſe of Boys were concern'd in the Action; many People being pleas'd with the counterſeit ſhow of what they could wiſh were done in reality.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64970:16"/>
            <p>Two days after, as if they had be-thought themſelves that they had not done legally, to burn the Pope before due conviction, they went to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Houſe, crying out No Papiſt, No Papiſt, as they pasſt by the Guard; and getting into the Houſe, the chief of the Multitude taking their places, to retrieve and juſtifie their miſtake, they arraign'd his Holineſs before his Judges, and gave him in charge to a Jury, who brought him in Guilty; upon which he was ſentenc'd to be burnt, and ſo the over-ſight being made good, they declared for a Free Parliament. Nor did theſe Tumults ceaſe for many days among the Boys, who at another time got up to the Market Croſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd a Free Parliament, and offer'd two thouſand pounds for <hi>Melfords</hi> Head.</p>
            <p>And then it was, that upo the 25th of <hi>December</hi> his Holineſs was burnt in a true orderly manner by the Students themſelves, marching with their Swords in their Hands, every Claſſis under their particular Captain, and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege Mace carry'd before them by the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64970:17"/>Under-Porter, bare, the Haut-boys play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the while; beſides the Honour which the Privy Council and City Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates did them to be Spectators of their Show.</p>
            <p>But in the attempt of the Multitude the next day upon the Abby, which is the Kings Houſe, wherein there was at that time a Popiſh Chappel, they had at firſt but courſe Entertainment: For the Chancellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho he found <hi>Edinborough</hi> too hot to hold him; yet ſuch was his Kindneſs, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Papiſt, for the Popiſh Relicks which he left behind, that he gave particular order to one Captain <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> to defend the Abby with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; which the Captain with a true Papiſtical Zeal, readily undertook to do. So that when the Boys went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho without any other Arms then their Links and Battoons, upon their preſſing too cloſe upon him, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ordred his Men to let fly among 'em; ſo that many were wounded, and ſome died of their Wounds. Of which, complaint being made to the Council, they ſent ſix <hi>Heralds</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64970:17"/>
               <hi>Wallace</hi> and his Men to lay down their Arms, and ſurrender themſelves and the Guard of the Place, to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the City: But the <hi>Heralds</hi> were anſwer'd in the ſame Language with the Boys. Thereupon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ordred a ſufficient number of the Train'd Bands to remove him by force; who accordingly fell upon <hi>Wallace,</hi> and conſtrain'd both him and his Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to flight. And then it was that the Boys to revenge the loſs of their Mates, broke in pell-mell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Abby, and burnt all that they found in the Chappel, fir'd the Jeſuites College, the Popiſh Printing-Houſe, the Abby Church; and in a word, all that they found in the Papiſts Houſes, in the Suburbs and <hi>Cannigate;</hi> ſparing nothing but what was purloyn'd away by ſuch as bore them Company, with a deſign to plunder.</p>
            <p>During theſe Extravagances in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>Scotland</hi> had withdrawn himſelf to <hi>Caſtle-Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> but not thinking himſelf ſafe there, he reſolv'd for <hi>France;</hi> and with that reſolution, with all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64970:18"/>imaginable, himſelf in Womans Habit, and his Wife in Mans Apparrel upon the 10th of <hi>December</hi> got on board a Veſſel bound from the <hi>Frith</hi> of <hi>Caſtle-Drummond,</hi> and was juſt under Sale with a fair Wind. At what time a certain Perſon on Horſe-back, riding by <hi>Kirkalden,</hi> where the Seamen us'd to walk, call'd to them, and inform'd them, That there was a good Prize in the Ship which they ſaw under Sale, meaning the Chancellor of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Thereupon about ſix and thirty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sea-men, commanded by one <hi>Wilſon,</hi> that had been a <hi>Buccaneer</hi> in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> furniſh'd themſelves with Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and having got a light Boat, without any Proviſion, only a little Brandy, and without any otder from any Magiſtrate, ſet ſail immediately, and coming up with the Ship that Night, boarded her, and enquir'd for the Chancellor, who was at firſt denied to be in the Ship; but after ſome little ſearch, they found Him and his Lady in the diſguiſe already mention'd. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they brought the Ship back, and carry'd the Priſoners, together
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64970:18"/>with one <hi>Nicholſon</hi> a Prieſt, and Regent of the Colledge at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Kirkaldy,</hi> from whence the Council order'd the Chancellor to be remov'd to <hi>Sterling</hi> Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The face of Affairs being thus alter'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as in <hi>England,</hi> there was only a Council of the prime Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that Kingdom to watch over the ſafety of the Nation at ſuch a Tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Conjuncture.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs they took care that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſonages of the higheſt rank in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, ſhould be in a readineſs in <hi>England</hi> to make their Addreſs to the moſt Excellent of Princes, his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſo ſoon as he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the leaſt Deference that could be expected they ſhould give to a Prince, who by a particular Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the People of that Kingdom, had ſignify'd his Reſolutions to be no leſs careful to reſtore the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to maintain the Proteſtant Religion there, then he was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64970:19"/>to purſue the ends of his Declaration to the people of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is the recital of that Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be here omitted, as being ſo full and generally ſatisfactory to all the good People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that there was nothing more welcom to their Ears, nor any thing next under God, wherein they more entirely placed the Aſſurances of their Deliverance; more eſpcially when they ſaw it attended with an armed Force under the Conduct of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Fortitude to make it good.

                        <p>IT is both certain and evident to all men, that the publick Peace and Happineſs of any State or Kingdom cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, where the Laws, Liberties and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64970:19"/>eſtabliſhed by the Lawful Authority in it, are openly Tranſgreſſed and Annull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: More eſpecially, where the alteration of Religion is endeavoured, and that a Religion which is contrary to Law, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be introduced: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which thoſe who are moſt immediately concerned in it, are indeſpenſably bound to endeavour to preſerve and maintain the Eſtabliſhed Laws, Liberties and Cuſtoms; and above all, the Religion and Worſhip of God, that is Eſtabliſhed amongſt them: And to take ſuch an effectual care, that the Inhabitants of the ſaid State or Kingdom, may neither be deprived of their Religion, nor of their Civil Rights. Which is ſo much the more neceſſary, becauſe the Greatneſs and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity both of Kings, Royal Families, and of all ſuch as are in Authority, as well as the Happineſs of their Subjects and People depend, in a moſt eſpecial manner, upon the exact Obſervation and Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of theſe their Laws, Libertie: and Cuſtoms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe grounds it is, that We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any longer forbear to declare, That to Our great Regret, We ſee that thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, who have now the chief Credit
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64970:20"/>with the King, have no other Deſign, but to overturn the Religion, Laws and Liberties of thoſe Realms; and to ſubject them in all things relating to their Conſciences, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Properties, to Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and that not only by ſecret and indirect ways, but in ſuch an open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſguiſed manner, that their Deſigns are now become viſible to all that conſider them.</p>
                        <p>And indeed the lamentable Effects of an Arbitrary Power and of Evil Counſels are ſo manifeſt in the deplorable State of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that both our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience do prompt us to an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of them. For when We conſider the ſad Condition of that Nation, though always affectionate to the Royal Family, and govern'd for many Ages by Laws made by the Authority of their Kings, and of the Eſtates of Parliament, and by common Cuſtoms, is reduced to by endeavours that have been uſed to change the Conſtitution of the Monarchy Regulate by Laws, into a a Deſpotick and Arbitrary Power; which doth evidently appear, not only by the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Evil Counſellors in Power, but by the deliberate and expreſs publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64970:20"/>bearing that the King is an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarch, to whom Obedience ought to be given in all things without reſerve, thereby to make way to introduce what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they pleaſe, without ſo much as the neceſſity of the Conſent of the Nation by their Eſtates in Parliament. Whilſt We conſider and ponder theſe things, as We cannot but be touched with a tender Senſe of thoſe Miſeries, ſo the giving ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to them, as may be proper, and may anſwer the expectation of all good Men, and true Proteſtants, is the great thing which We propoſe to our ſelves in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; the Equity whereof will be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified to the World, if what hath been acted at the inſtigation of thoſe Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors be further impartially weighed.</p>
                        <p>It is well known that the Laws, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Rights of the Kingdom have been overturned to the great prejudice of King and People, whilſt thus, all Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Confidence and Truſt is removed. And it is no leſs known what have been the arbitrary Procedures of an incroaching Privy Council; for although by the Laws enacted by the Authority of King and Parliament, it is expreſly prohibited, that the Popiſh
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64970:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>Religion ſhould be profeſſed, or Seminary Prieſts ſuffer'd within the Kingdom; or that the Children of any Noblemen or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſhould be ſent'abroad to be Educated in Popiſh Colleges; yet have theſe Evil Counſellors order'd or ſuffered young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen to be taken from their Relations, and to be ſent abroad to be inſtructed in Jeſuits Colleges, and have likewiſe cauſed Schools to be erected under the conduct of Popiſh Prieſts, and that in the Capital City of the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>In an open contempt alſo of the known Laws of the Kingdom, Papiſts are put into Places of higheſt Truſt both Civil and Military, and entruſted with all the Forts and Magazines. The Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Royal Boroughs, the third Eſtate of Parliament, having as many Deputies in it as all the Shires in the Kingdom, are taken away, and they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the free Election of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Town-Councils, to the manifeſt Violation of their Charters, Eſtabliſhed by Law and immemorial Poſſeſſion. And all this is done by meer Arbitrary Power, without any Citation, Trial or Sentence.</p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64970:21"/>
                        <p>And whereas no Nation whatſoever can ſubſiſt without the Adminiſtration of good and impartial Juſtice, upon which Mens Lives and Liberties, their Honours and Eſtates depend, yet thoſe Evil Counſellors have ſubjected theſe to an Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power: having turned out Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who by Law ought to continue during their Life or their good Behaviour, becauſe they would not conform themſelves to their Intentions, and put others in their Places, who they believe would be more compliant, and that without any regard to their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; by which it evidently appears that thoſe Evil Counſellors deſign to render themſelves the abſolute Maſters of the Lives, Honors and Eſtates of the Subjects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being reſtrained by any Rule or Law.</p>
                        <p>By the influence of the ſame Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors hath a moſt exorbitant Power been exerciſed in impoſing Bonds and Oaths up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whole Shires without any Law or Act of Parliament; in permitting Free Quarters to the Soldiers, although they had a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Eſtabliſhment for their Pay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Kingdom was doubly burthened without any redreſs; in Impriſoning Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen without any, ſo much as alledged,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64970:22"/>Reaſon, forcing many to accuſe and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt themſelves, impoſing arbitrary Fines, frighting and haraſſing many parts of the Country with Intercommoning and Juſtice-Aires, making ſome incur the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of Life and Fortune for the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and harmleſs Converſe, even with their neareſt Relations outlawed: And thus bringing a Conſternation upon a great part of the Kingdom, which when Outlawries and Intercommonings went out againſt multitudes upon the ſlendereſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, was involved ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally in that danger, that thoſe Counſellors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſo obnoxious as to find it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have Pardons and Indemnities, whilſt the poor People were left to mercy; impowring Officers and Soldiers to act upon the Subjects living in quiet and full peace, the greateſt Barbarities, in deſtroying them by Hanging, Shooting and Drowning them, without any form of Law, or reſpect to Age or Sex, not giving ſome of them time to pray to God for mercy; and this for no other reaſon, becauſe they would not anſwer or ſatisfie them in ſuch Queſtions as they propoſed to them without any Warrant of Law, and againſt the common Intereſt of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64970:22"/>Mankind, which frees all Men from being obliged to diſcover their ſecret thoughts. Beſides a great many other Violences and Oppreſſions, to which that poor Nation hath been expoſed, without any hope of having an end put to them, or to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from them.</p>
                        <p>And that the Arbitrary and Illegal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of thoſe Evil Counſellors might be juſtified and ſupported, ſuch a Declaration hath been procured by them, as ſtrikes at the Root of the Government, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the moſt ſacred Rights of it, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all Parliaments unneceſſary, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all Defences of Religion, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property, by an aſſumed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Abſolute Power, to which Obedience is required without reſerve; which every good Chriſtian is perſwaded to be due to God Almighty alone, all whoſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are always juſt and good.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Evil Counſellors have uſed their utmoſt endeavours to aboliſh the Penal Laws, excluding all who are Proteſtants from publick Truſt, which give too great a Check to their Deſigns. For the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of this, a Liberty hath been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Diſſenters, but ſuch an one, as that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64970:23"/>the continuance thereof is plainly inſinuated to depend upon their hearty concurrence for Aboliſhing the above-mentioned Penal Laws, the only Legal Defence of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; although the Diſſenters have juſt cauſe of Diſtruſt, when they call to mind how ſome hundreds of their Miniſters were driven out of their Churches without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accuſation or Citation: The filling of many whole places with Ignorant and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Perſons, hath been one great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all thoſe Miſeries which that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for a long time hath groaned under. And Diſſenters have but ſmall ground to reſt on any preſent eaſe founded upon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, which may be recalled every hour, and which in the firſt and ſecond Editions of it gave no relief to them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that not many Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the greateſt of the forementioned Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities and Barbarities had been exerciſed upon them.</p>
                        <p>But to crown all, there are great and violent preſumptions inducing us to believe that thoſe Evil Counſellors, in order to the carrying on of their ill Deſigns, and to the gaining to themſelves the more time for the effecting of them, for the encouraging
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64970:23"/>of their Complices, and for the diſcouraging of all good Subjects, have publiſhed, That the Queen hath brought forth a Son, though there have appeared both during the Queens pretended Bigneſs, and in the manner in which the Birth was managed, ſo many juſt and viſible grounds of ſuſpition, that not only We our ſelves, but all the good Subjects of thoſe Kingdoms do vehemently ſuſpect that the pretended Prince was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver born by the Queen. And it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly known to all the World, that many both doubted of the Queens Bigneſs, and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any one thing done to ſatisfie them, or to put an end to their Doubts.</p>
                        <p>And ſince our deareſt and moſt entirely beloved Conſort, the Princeſs, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe We our ſelves have ſo great an intereſt in this matter, and ſuch a Right as all the World knows to the Succeſſion of theſe Kingdoms, which thoſe Men have attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to violate, for preventing of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of Miſeries, by the lawful Succeſſors of the Crown, Educated by the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, in the true profeſſion of the Proteſtant Religion, We cannot excuſe our ſelves from eſpouſing the true intereſt of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64970:24"/>theſe Nations in matters of ſuch high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and from contributing all that lies in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, for the defence of the Laws and Liberties thereof, the maintaining of the Proteſtant Religion in them, and the ſecuring the People in the enjoyment of their juſt Rights.</p>
                        <p>But that Our Intentions may be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that no perſon may doubt or pretend to doubt thereof, to excuſe themſelves from concurring with us in this juſt Deſign, for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Good of the Nation. We do Declare that the freeing that Kingdom from all hazard of Popery and Arbitrary Power for the future, and the delivering it from what at the preſent doth expoſe it to both, the ſetling of it by Parliament, upon ſuch a ſolid Baſis as to its Religious and Civil concerns, as may moſt effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs all the abovementioned Grievances, are the true Reaſons of our preſent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking as to that Nation.</p>
                        <p>And therefore We perſwade Our ſelves that Our Endeavours to give the beſt Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance We can for the Relief of ſo diſtreſſed a Kingdom, ſhall not only not be miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued, but ſhall alſo be accompanied with a chearful and univerſal Concurrence of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64970:24"/>whole Nation, that even thoſe who have been Inſtruments for the enſlaving of it, will now ſhew their diſlike of what they have done, by their timous and ſeaſonable diligence for its reſcue: And that if any ſhall not give us that Aſſiſtance which their Conſcience to God, and their Reſpect to their Country oblige them to, they ſhall be juſtly charged with all the Evils that may be the effects of ſuch a want of their Duty.</p>
                        <p>And as We Our ſelves deſire to truſt to the Almighty God alone for the Succeſs of Our Arms, ſo we expect all good Men, that they will apply themſelves moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him for his bleſſing upon Our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that ſo they may tend to the Glory of his Great Name, to the Eſtabliſhment of the Reformed Churches, and to the Peace and Happineſs of that Kingdom.</p>

            <p>So ſoon as this Declaration came to be divulg'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Generality of the Nation ſoon concurred to joyn againſt the common Adverſaries of their Laws and Religion, and to throw themſelves into the Protection of the moſt generous of Princes, whom they ſaw more ſollicitous for their welfare and proſperity, then mindful of the Hazards into which he engaged his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to redeem them from the Yoak of their Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>His Highneſs therefore being arriy'd at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, the Scotch Nobility and Gentry waited upon him upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>January,</hi> being the day by his Highneſs appointed for them to attend him. So ſoon as they came, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made them a ſhort Speech to let them know,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the only reaſon which induced him to undergo ſo great an undertaking, was, that he ſaw the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdoms overturn'd, and the Proteſtant Religion in imminent danger; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing there were in Town ſo many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen and Gentlemen, he had call'd them together, that he might have their Advice,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64970:25"/>what was to be done for ſecuring the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and reſtoring their Laws and Liberties, according to his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſoon as his Highneſs retir'd, the Lords and Gentlemen went to the Council Chamber at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and after they had choſen Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> their Preſident, they fell into Debate what Advice was fit to be given to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon thoſe weighty Propoſals which he had made them; and after ſome hours Deliberation, they agreed upon the Heads of what they intended; and appointed the Clerks, together with their Aſſiſtants, to draw up in writing what the Aſſembly thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to propound to his Highneſs, and to bring it to their next Meeting in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>The next day being <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the eighth of <hi>January,</hi> the writing was brought into the Aſſembly of Lords and Gentlemen; and after ſome time ſpent in conſidering the fitteſt way to convene a General Meeting of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of <hi>Scotland;</hi> at length they agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and appointed the Advice to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64970:26"/>written fair over, according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments. But as they were about to depart for that time, the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> propoſed to the reſt as his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, That they ſhould move the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to deſire the King to return and call a Free Parliament, as being the beſt way to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion and Property, and to heal all Breaches; which ſeem'd to diſſatisfie the whole Meeting, even Duke <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> himſelf though he were Father to the Earl. But the Aſſembly breaking up, there was then no farther notice taken of it.</p>
            <p>The next day being <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the ninth of <hi>January,</hi> they met again in the Council Chamber; at what time Sir <hi>Patrick Hume,</hi> remembring the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal made by the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> deſir'd to know if there was any perſon preſent who would ſecond it. But no body appearing to do it, he ſaid, That what the Earl had propos'd was evidently oppoſite and injurious to his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Undertaking, his Declaration, and his good Intentions of preſerving the Proteſtant Religion,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64970:26"/>and of reſtoring their Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therein expreſs'd, and further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd the Meeting to declare the ſame to be their Opinion of it. The Lord <hi>Cardroſs</hi> ſeconded Sir <hi>Patrick Humes</hi>'s Motion; but then it was anſwered by Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Preſident of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, That their buſineſs was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare an Advice to be tendred to the Prince; and the Advice being then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be put to the Vote, there was no need that the Aſſembly ſhould give their Opinion of the Earls Propoſal, which neither before nor after Sir <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Motion any of the Company had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to own or ſecond, ſo that it was quite out of doors; beſides that, the Vote of the Aſſembly upon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice brought in by their Order, would ſufficiently decare their Opinion; which being ſeconded by the Earl of <hi>Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cardoſs,</hi> Sir <hi>Patrick</hi> acquieſced in it; and ſo the Aſſembly unanimouſly Voted the following Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>

               <hi>At the ſame time the Eal of</hi> Crawfourd <hi>made it his Suit to His Highneſs, that himſelf, the Earl of</hi> Louthian, <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who came to Town ſince the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was preſented, might have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſubſcribe it alſo; which was done accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Anſwer of his Highneſs gave great ſatisfaction to the Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who tendered the Advice; ſo that every thing being prepared in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Elections, and the ſeveral Members being returned according to the Methods preſcribed, the Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſiſting of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons of the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>aſſembled at</hi> Edinborough <hi>the Fourteenth day of</hi> March, <hi>all in one Houſe, according to the cuſtom of that Realm. The Biſhop of</hi> Edinborough <hi>ſaid Prayers, in which he prayed to God to have compaſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on King</hi> James, <hi>wherein he did well, had he not gon on with his Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to reſtore him; however it ſhewed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64970:29"/>the Temper of the Man. Upon the chooſing of their Preſident and Clerks, the Biſhops and ſome others were for the Marques of</hi> Aihol <hi>to have been Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, but Duke</hi> Hamilton <hi>carried it by Forty Voices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt thing they took into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration was, the ſecurity and ſafety of their Sitting, in regard the City of</hi> Edinborough <hi>where they ſat, was then at the mercy of the Canon of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which was in the hands of the D. of</hi> Gourdon, <hi>a Roman Patholick. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they paſſed an Act,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in regard the Duke of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> and ſome others of the Popiſh Religion under him, entruſted with the keeping of the Caſtle of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> were not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by the Law of this Kingdom, they did therefore grant a Warrant to the Earls of <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>Tweddale,</hi> to repair im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Caſtle of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> and require both Him and others of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion there, in the Name of the States of the Kingdom, to remove out of the ſaid Caſtle within twenty four Hours after the Intimation, and to leave the charge thereof
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64970:29"/>to the next Commanding Officer, being a Proteſtant. And he and they doing the ſame, the Eſtates gave aſſurance, that he and they were and ſhould be exonerated and ſecured as to any thing they have acted in that, or any other Station contrary to Law, as being Papiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>While thoſe Lords were doing their duty in purſuance of the Act of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the Meeting of Eſtates went on, and in the firſt place named a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Elections, conſiſting of Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; that is to ſay, five out of each State. This gave an occaſion to a debate,</hi> Whither the Lords Spiritual were a diſtinct Eſtate, or only a part of the ſame Eſtate with the Lords Temporal? <hi>But in regard the Houſe inclined to the Negative, the debate was let fall. However by the nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Committee, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make a Judgment of the Meeting; for that of Fifteen which were of it, at leaſt twelve were ſhrewdly ſuppoſed to be inclined to follow the methods of</hi> England; <hi>beſides that the Houſes reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Proteſtation made againſt the Earl of</hi> Argyle<hi>'s ſitting among them, till his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64970:30"/>fathers Attainder ſhould be reverſed, was no ſmall confirmation of what the people conjectured. But nothing more availed to give the people a true notion of the Noble deſigns of the Meeting, then the following Speech, which was ſpoken by a Member at the opening of the Convention; which being ſo well received as it was, was a clear evidence that they were not met to favour the Intereſt of King</hi> James.</p>
            <p>WE are now, <hi>ſaid the Gentleman,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together by His Highneſs the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> to Conſult and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what methods will be moſt proper to ſecure our Religion, Laws and Liberties; in Order to which the firſt thing that will fall under our conſideration, is the ſettling the Soveraign Power.</p>
            <p>I take it for granted that you are fully convinced, that <hi>King James the ſeventh,</hi> by his many violations of the Fundamental Laws, by his endeavouring to eſtabliſh a Deſpotic and Arbitrary Power, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Popery (though he himſelf had confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all the Laws that were enacted in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Proteſtant Religion) has left
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64970:30"/>us at a time when we needed his Protection moſt. The Eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> are upon us, and it is in our power to make our ſelves and our Poſterity either happy or miſerable, by making a choice either to call back K. <hi>James,</hi> and hazard once more all that men account dear, to his Mercy, or to ſettle the Government on ſome other, under whom we may live peaceable lives, without the perpetual Terror of being ſwallowed up by Popery and Arbitrary Government, which all good Men hoped were now baniſhed; and yet behold a new off-ſpring is ſprung up, which eagerly pleads for both, under the miſtaken names of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange that any man can be ſo far degenerate as to prefer Slavery to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and that they ſhould be ſo much in Love with <hi>chains,</hi> that when they were fairly ſhaken off, they ſhould run furiouſly to find them again. As if the <hi>Ottoman</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Government were ſo charming in our Countrey, that we cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, though we have ſo lately groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſmal burden of it. And it might have been ſuppoſed that even they who had been inſtrumental in the Enſlaving their Fellow brethren, and were grown fat with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64970:31"/>ſucking the Nations Blood, would have taken another method to reconcile themſelves then by perſwading us to purchaſe their ſafety, at ſo vaſt an expence as the ruine of more than three parts of the Nation.</p>
            <p>If we do but a little reflect upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which thoſe men, blinded by ſelf In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, make uſe of to delude the Nation into a ſecurity, that wanted but very little of proving fatal to it, and compare them with the ſtrong reaſons we have to perſwade us from being ſo impoſed on, they will be found ſo weak and impertinent, that we may judge it next to impoſſibility, to ſuffer our ſelves to be twice deceived. But if the experience of our former Miſeries (the very thoughts of renewing which, cauſe all good men to tremble) has not made us wiſer; and be not of Efficacy enough to deter us from venturing another Shipwrack, and expoſing all again to the diſpoſal of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, 'tis more then probable that God has abandoned us to believe ſtrong Deluſions.</p>
            <p>They will eadeavour to perſwade us that Kings are exempted from puniſhment here on Earth, and that nothing they do can be quarrelled by their Subjects, which indeed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64970:31"/>might be urged among the <hi>Turks,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve nothing from the power of their <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and where 'tis death to diſpute his Commands though never ſo Arbitrary and Tyrannical. But with what impudence can ſuch ſiuff be impoſed upon us, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admit our Kings to the Government, till they ſwear to Rule us according to Law and no otherwiſe? The Laws are the only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity we have for our Lives and properties, which if our Soveraigns break, Subjects cannot be blam'd, for making uſe of the ordinary means to preſerve them; and ſince that cannot be done without withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obedience from ſuch a Magiſtrate as goes about to deſtroy them, ſuch an Act can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to puniſh, becauſe we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him to which he has a juſt claim, but only ſhun the occaſion of making our ſelves miſerable. The Speculative Doctrin of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> has done too much miſchief among us, and what has befallen the King may be juſtly attributed to it, for the believing he might do what he pleaſed without Oppoſition, encouraged him to take thoſe meaſures which have drawn all theſe Misfortunes upon him.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64970:32"/>
            <p>Others are ſo fond as to believe they may be ſecure in calling back the King, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſo limit him, that it may not be in his power to hurt them. But what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions of our contrivance can bind the King? For moſt certainly they can never be voluntarily condeſcended to; and what is conſtrained and done by force, the Law declares to be null and void; to the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which the Popes diſpencing Power being joyned, would quickly blow up thoſe <hi>Sampſons</hi> Cords, and the Royal power would again revive with all its luſtre and vigor.</p>
            <p>In the next place the King is of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that in a famous Council has Decreed, That there is no Faith to be kept with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, much leſs with Subjects whom the King looks upon as ſo many Rebels, and will not miſs to treat them as ſuch, when ever they give him the Opportunity of doing it. Then we may lament our Miſeries, but it will not be in our power to remedy them: For a <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> will not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to reſcue us, with ſuch vast Expence, and ſo great hazard to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:64970:32"/>
            <p>Again, What Argument has the King given us, ſince he left us, that he will be more faithful in obſerving his Word and Oaths then hitherto he has been? Does he not in a Letter lately Printed here, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay he has Ruled ſo as to give no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Complaint to his Subjects? Is not the ſame Letter ſigned by one who ſacrificed both his Honour &amp; his Conſcience to Intereſt, whoſe pernicious and headſtrong Counſells poſted him to his Ruine, though all that has been done cannot make him ſenſible of it? Is K. <hi>James the ſeventh,</hi> by breathing the <hi>French</hi> Air, become leſs a Bigot to Popery? It were a Dream to fancy it. For ſo long as the <hi>Vatican</hi> Thunders out Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications againſt all that uſe not their utmoſt endeavours to extirpate Hereſie, a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> muſt have no Religion at all, if they be not terrible to him.</p>
            <p>But ſay they, the Peace of the Nation cannot be otherwiſe ſecur'd, nor Factions and Diviſions be extinguiſhed but by calling in the King. But what Factions do you obſerve but what they themſelves foment on purpoſe to diſturb our Harmony? All which would immediately dye if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were ſettled on thoſe who beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64970:33"/>For then if theſe Fops continued ſtill fond of Tyranny and Popery they would be chaſtized as diſturbers of the publick Peace. If the King return we muſt burſt out into a flame, and <hi>England</hi> that has already declared will quickly be upon us, an Enemy too Potent and too numerous for us, although we were united; beſides that we cut off all hopes of a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with that Nation, and deprive our ſelves of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Advantage, which would redound to all ſorts of people, and would be the only means to ſupport an impoveriſht and ſinking Nation.</p>
            <p>The happy Succeſs the Prince<hi>'s</hi> Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize has met with, has made a conſiderable alteration in the Affairs of <hi>Europe.</hi> For thereby the Great Enemy of the Proteſtants, and even of Chriſtianity it ſelf, is ſo far humbled as from a proud inſulting Enemy to become a Suppliant for Peace, well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that if <hi>England</hi> joyn with thoſe other Princes whom his Inſolence, Cruelty and Avarice have ſo juſtly Arm'd againſt him, his ruine is inevitable.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I beſeech you conſider what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they are that would inſtill this poyſon into yee. Either ſuch as poſtponing the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64970:33"/>Common Good of the Nation, are wholly acted by Self-Intereſt, conſidering that in a Government where Juſtice and Mercy equally flows, Vertue and Merit, not Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany will be rewarded. Or ſuch as being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Nature of Government, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver examin'd what meaſures the Law of Nature and Nations have ſet to Mens O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Or ſuch as have been Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental toward the enſlaving their Country, and are afraid, if they be call'd to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that they muſt be brought to condign Puniſhment. If ſuch cannot ſucceed in their deſigns, they hope at leaſt to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt in the General Confuſion: and if Heav'n fail them, they ſummon Hell to their Aid: Not that Love to their Prince, but Intereſt drives thoſe Criminals to ſuch Attempts; ſo that 'tis no wonder they take ſo much pains to ſow Diviſion among us. But no perſon of Wit and Judgment, nor any good Man truly Proteſtant, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be ſo groſly impoſed upon by ſuch Firebrands, who would build their future Imaginary Greatneſs on the Ruine of our Religion, Laws and Countrey.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:64970:34"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Being thus ſettled to their buſineſs, for the greater ſecurity of their Sitting, becauſe of the vaſt concourſe of People from all parts of the Kingdom, who were generally arm'd; it was thought requiſite, for the prevention of tumult and diſorder, to Command all perſons from the Town that were not Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, or Retainers to the Members of the Convention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time the Lords having acquitted themſelves of their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the following Paper was ſent from the Duke of</hi> Gourdon, <hi>and read the next day in the Meeting, wherein he gave them to underſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he was</hi> willing to comply with the Commiſſion he received by the Earles of <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>Tweddale,</hi> as to his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val from the Caſtle of <hi>Edinborough;</hi> though he could not do ſo as a Papiſt, that being dangerous, and he not convicted. <hi>For that he hoped</hi> that his being in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, without taking the Test, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an Act of Parliament, was no Conviction of Popery. <hi>To this he added.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he had</hi> received not long ago a Letter from the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> deſiring
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64970:34"/>he would leave the Caſtle; which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to do, but expected ſome reaſonable things to be firſt granted to himſelf and Garriſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hop'd he had</hi> not merited ſo ill of his Country, as that he might not be truſted with the Caſtle, until a Return came to that Letter which he expected every Hour. But if that could not be granted barely on his promiſe not to moleſt or harm any Perſon, eſpecially thoſe of that Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſembly. <hi>He proffer'd</hi> Hoſtages of Bayl to the value of Twenty Thouſand Pound Sterling for his Peaceable Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Otherwiſe he expected before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval,</hi> Firſt, a General Indemnity for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Friends, both Proteſtants and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; as likewiſe abſolute ſecurity for their Lives and Fortunes in time coming, and aſſurance the ſame ſhould be ratify'd in the next Parliament. Secondly, Security for all Proteſtants in the Garriſon, who deſign to ſtay in it, to continue in their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and for himſelf, and thoſe who ſhould go out with him, either Proteſtants or Papiſts, to go beyond Sea, or to remain within the Kingdom, as their occaſions
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64970:35"/>ſhould lead them. Laſtly, That the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be paid off all by-gone Arrears, and have Liberty to diſpoſe of their Goods within the Caſtle as they pleas'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Convention was quick in their Reply, and agreed upon certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, which were ſent away forthwith to the Duke, to this effect;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Meeting of Eſtates having conſider'd the Paper given in and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by the Duke of</hi> Gourdon, <hi>in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their Order, did declare, That it was not the Mind of the Meeting, that the Dukes officiating as Governour of the Caſtle of</hi> Edinborough, <hi>or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Imployment, or his quitting his command at that time ſhould import a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acknowledgment or Conviction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, or thoſe under his Command of his or their being Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it was likewiſe reſolved, That the Covention would not allow of the Dukes keeping the Caſtle upon Promiſe, Bail or Hoſtages, until he got a Return of the Letter written by him to the Prince of</hi> Orange.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:64970:35"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Then it was farther Reſolved, That the Indempnity offered by the Meeting of the Eſtates ſhould only extend to thoſe belonging to the Garriſon, and their Servants either Proteſtants or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; that the Perſons who were to have the benefit of the ſaid Indempnity ſhould be named expreſly, if the Duke deſir'd it; and that the Indempnity to be granted by the Meeting ſhould have a Clauſe Inſerted, that it ſhould be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in the next Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as to the laſt Article, It was moreover Reſolved, That thoſe of the Garriſon who were pleaſed to retire with the Duke, ſhould have leave ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go out of the Kingdom or ſtay in it as they ſhould think fit, and ſhould have Liberty to diſpoſe of their Goods and have ſafe Conduct granted them for that Effect, if the ſame were deſired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſſolution of the Meeting of the Eſtates. But that they ſhould not take out with them any Arms, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition or Store, but what they ſhould make out to belong properly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>

               <hi>And laſtly, That it was agreed by the Convention, That the Officers and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhould be paid their Arrears; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that the Meeting refuſed to give them Aſſurance of their being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Employment.</hi>

               <hi>But notwithſtanding theſe Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentions, (for the Convention was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have bin rid of ſuch a ſuſpitious Neighbour at any Honourable rate) the Duke of</hi> Gourdon <hi>who was not ignorant of their Fears, return'd an Anſwer to theſe Reſolves ſo full of new and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Demands, that the Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was fully ſatisfied, that the Duke was only trifling with them, as he had done with His Majeſty of</hi> England, <hi>to gain time: For King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary <hi>had bin Proclaim'd at</hi> London <hi>ever ſince the Thirteenth of</hi> February <hi>before. So that the Convention per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Dukes deſign, which was to keep off in expectation of ſome Attempts which would be made in</hi> Scotland <hi>in behalf of the late King</hi> James, <hi>and of which he was deſirous to ſee the Iſſue, They order'd the Heralds, with the uſual
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64970:36"/>Solemnities, to Summon him to ſurrender the Caſtle, under the Penalty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to proclaim him Traytor in caſe of refuſal; and to forbid all people to have any Correſpondence with him. Which was accordingly performed, and Orders alſo given to block up the Caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soon after a Letter was deliver'd to the Convention, by one</hi> Crane, <hi>who went under the Notion of a ſervant to the late Queen in</hi> France. <hi>But the Lord Preſident acquainted the Members at the ſame time, that there was a Letter alſo from His Majeſty of</hi> England. <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which a Debate aroſe about the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Letters; at what time the Earl of</hi> Lothian <hi>mov'd, That ſince they were met at the Deſire of his Majeſty of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>they ought to give his Letter the Precedence; which being put to the Vote was carried in the affirmative; and the King of</hi> England<hi>'s Letter was read, the Contents of which were as follow:</hi>

                  <p>WE are very ſenſible of the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Concern, which your Nation has evidenced toward <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and Our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Religion and Liberty, which were in ſuch imminent Danger. Neither can we in the leaſt doubt of your Conſidence in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, after having ſeen how far ſo many of your Nobility and Gentry have own'd our Declaration, countenancing and concurring with us in our Endeavours, and deſiring <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, that We would take upon us the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Affairs Civil and Military, and to call a Meeting of the Eſtates, for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion, and the Ancient Laws and Liberties of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which accordingly we have done.</p>
                  <p>Now it lies on You to enter upon ſuch Conſultations as are moſt probable to ſettle You on ſure and laſting foundations; which We hope you will ſet about with all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſpeed, with regard to the publick

                  <p>We were glad to find that ſo many of the Nobility and Gentry, when here in <hi>London,</hi> were ſo much inclin'd to a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both Kingdoms, and that they did look upon it as one of the beſt means for procuring the Happineſs of both Nations, and ſettling of a lasting Peace among them; which would be advantagious to Both, they living in the ſame Iſland, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Language, and the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt of Religion and Liberty; eſpecially at this Juncture, when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of both are ſo reſtleſs, endeavouring to make and increaſe Jealouſies and Diviſions, which they will be ready to improve to their own Advantage and the Ruin of <hi>Britain.</hi> We being of the ſame Opinion, as to the uſefulneſs of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much before our Eyes as the Glory of God, Eſtabliſhing the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Peace and Happineſs of theſe Nations, are reſolv'd to uſe Our

            <p>This Letter being directed to Perſons at that time ſitting, who either lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ignominy of his Attainders, or had elſe ſeverely otherwiſe ſuffered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves or their neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the dilacerating ſtripes of his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical ſeverity could not ſo ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the anguiſh of their Sufferings as to be ſugar'd up into a Reconciliation, by the fair Promiſes of a Perſon that had loſt the Reputation of being true to his Publick Word. Beſides that there was ſo little Majeſty in the Style of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter altogether precarious, and anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Lowneſs of his Condition, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like a plant at the latter end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn</hi> putting forth ſome fruitleſs Buds of vain Aſſurances: So that as the one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſlighted it, ſo thoſe that were moſt inclin'd to favour it were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Countenance to ſee the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64970:41"/>Vanity of ſuch an unſeaſonable Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Rhetorick. A Committee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was appointed to draw up an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Letter, but no man ſo much as mov'd for an Anſwer to that of King <hi>James;</hi> onely the Man that brought it, beg'd a Paſs to go to him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Twelfth of <hi>March,</hi> at the Port of <hi>Kingſale;</hi> the Meſſenger offering Security not to carry to him any Letters or Papers from any Perſon whatſoever. But neither would that be granted; on the other ſide he was firſt ſecur'd, then enlarged upon Bail, till at length, not thinking him worth the keeping, they diſmiſſed him with a Paſs inſtead of an Anſwer. Nor indeed could King <hi>James</hi> expect better, if he may be thought to hope for better, who had no more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant a Meſſenger to ſend to a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Eſtates of a Kingdom, than ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a Gentleman Uſher to his Queen.</p>
            <p>While the Anſwer to His Majeſties Letter was drawing, the Meeting fell upon other Buſineſs, and ordered a Proclamation to be iſſue forth for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64970:42"/>in the Arrears of the Publick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. The firſt draught of this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation did not pleaſe, purporting, That the Money was to be employ'd <hi>for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Forces for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion;</hi> however after ſome debate, it was agreed that the Alteration ſhould be made by leaving out the Words, <hi>For Raiſing Forces,</hi> and ſo it paſs'd.</p>
            <p>This Proclamation was the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be one of their firſt Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in regard of the great occaſion which then they had to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and beleaguer the Caſtle which ſtill held out, to which purpoſe they were forc'd to make uſe of the City Train'd Bands, and the Country Militia, which could not well be diſmiſs'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pay or a Generous Gratuity.</p>
            <p>But then in purſuance of the main Affair which they were upon, of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing themſelves to the King, they thought it but requiſite, as a forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of what themſelves intended to give their Approbation of the Addreſs and Proceedings of the Nobility and Gentry that had been at <hi>London,</hi> and had there made it their Requeſt to His <hi>Highneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:64970:42"/>then Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to take upon him the Adminiſtration of the Government; which was done with that Reſpect which the Occaſion and Quality of the Perſons Merited.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew that they were not in the mean time unmindful of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes of their Neighbors, upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Letters from ſeveral Noblemen and Gentlemen in <hi>Ireland</hi> craving Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Arms and Ammunition, Four Thouſand Muskets, Two Thouſand Fuzee's, and Six Hundred Barrels of Gunpowder were order'd to be bought and ſent away.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the Meeting was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Viſcount <hi>Dundee,</hi> had ſtoln the opportunity of a Conference with the Duke of <hi>Gourdon</hi> at the Poſtern Gate of the Caſtle, notwithſtanding that the Convention had forbid all correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him under the Penalty of Treaſon; more over that <hi>Dundee</hi> who now came no more to the Convention, was ſeen near the City with about fifty Horſe. This ſomewhat alarumed the Convention, ſo that they immediately ordered him to be ſummoned; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64970:43"/>that he was Marched <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> toward <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> which was the Road to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and fearing leaſt he might have ſome deſign to ſurprize that Caſtle, which commands the Paſs of Communication between the Northern and Southern parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Major with fourſcore Horſe to follow him; and the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> who was then Governour of <hi>Sterling</hi> Caſtle, was ſent away by their Order to ſecure that Important Garriſon, againſt any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or ſurprize. And well knowing that ſmall ſparks many times kindle vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conflagrations, therefore that they might be in a Poſture to make oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where ever the flame brake out, they ordered all perſons from ſixteen to ſixty to be in a readineſs to take Arms when the Convention ſhould find it requiſite for the publick ſafety. Several ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Officers of the <hi>Militia,</hi> were turned out, and others put in their places; and Sir <hi>Patrick Hume,</hi> who was excepted out of the late Kings Indempnity, ordered to command the <hi>Militia</hi> Horſe of his Countrey: And farther, that eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men ſhould be Levyed and Arm'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64970:43"/>under the command of the Lord <hi>Leven;</hi> which was no ſooner intimated, but the Men came in within two hours time. Great care was alſo taken for the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Countries that lye next to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where as in all other parts orders were directed for diſ-arming the Papiſts, and ſettling the <hi>Militia</hi> in truſty Hands.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this care and vigilance, and the extraordinary Unity of the generality of the Nation, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herers to King <hi>James</hi> were not without hopes of having another game to play for their loſt ſtakes. Which made <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> ſtill dance about the Countrey like a Winter Exhalation to intice unwary followers; which made the Duke of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> farther perhaps encouraged by ſome bouncing Promiſes from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſend, as he called them his laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, and withall a Monitory Letter to the Convention, minding them to what Honours and Dignities K. <hi>James</hi>'s Predeceſſors had advanced moſt or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them to; and what marks of Royal Favour and Bounty he had conferred upon them, and which ought not to be forgot for the Errours and Miſcarriages
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64970:44"/>of poor four years Raign; ſo that if they would allow him Liberty to go over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> he would endeavour an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation between King <hi>James</hi> and the Eſtates of the Kingdom, to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Laws, Liberty and Property re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and eſtabliſhed. But both the Admonition of the Duke and his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking were rejected with that ſcorn, that they would not ſuffer the Monitory to be entred in their Journals, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that they had either received or read it. His demands were, <hi>An Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity for all Papiſts and Proteſtants that ſerv'd under him in the Caſtle, and for four or five Prieſts: That he might be ſecured againſt all Strangers or</hi> Camero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, by which he meant the Rabble, in and about the Town, at his coming out, <hi>and that he might have a Guard of forty Horſes for a ſafe Convoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Convention, though they ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Monitories, yet deſirous to have the Caſtle in their own hands, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his demands, <hi>That they would give ſecurity to himſelf and others in their lives and fortunes, ſo far as they had acted as Papiſts; and that the Prieſts ſhould have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64970:44"/>Paſſes to depart the Kingdom, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never to return again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he ſhould have the Guard and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy he demanded till he were over the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to</hi> Brunt-Iſland: <hi>And that a like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Guards ſhould Convoy him from thence homeward, which ſhould be disbanded within twenty four hours after his Arrival, he giving ſecurity to live peaceably, and not to diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding he had thus all in a manner granted him that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet it ſeems upon certain intelligence of the late Kings Landing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he thought fit to linger a little longer; and therefore ſent another meſſage ſoon after to the Convention, and the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> to acquaint them, that King <hi>James</hi> was arrived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore he would not ſurrender the Caſtle to the Eſtates, but would ſet up King <hi>James</hi>'s Standard, and give the uſual Volleys of Cannon; which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them not to be afraid of, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at: and accordingly he fired all his Cannon without Bullets, though to the great terrour of thoſe that lay under the Mercy of his Bullets.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:64970:45"/>
            <p>The Duke having thus laid aſide all thoughts of ſurrender; the Beſiegers went on with their Approaches, and the beſieged managed their defence the beſt they could; though to give the Duke of <hi>Gourdon</hi> his due, he was ſo ſparing to the City that he did not do the City half the miſchief he might have done; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the beſiegers threw their Bombs into the Caſtle, which ſtrangely dis-figured and ruined the Buildings within it. Nevertheleſs the Duke made no ſhew of Capitulation ſince his laſt Monitory meſſage of the 23d. of <hi>May</hi> till the 30th. of the ſame Month, at what time he beat a parly, and ſent a Letter to the Lord <hi>Roſs,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſpeak with him about ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affairs which he had to impart to his Lordſhip. With which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill being acquainted, gave leave to the Lord <hi>Roſs</hi> to meet the Duke upon the Caſtle <hi>Hill,</hi> but would not permit him to venture into the Caſtle; but the D. refuſed to meet him there, alledging, <hi>that he could not come out of the Caſtle to ſpeak or treat with any Perſon.</hi> So that miſſing his deſign, whatever it were, he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64970:45"/>that the old Regiſters were damnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore deſired they might be removed. But that the Council refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, looking upon it as a contrivance to linger away time, to get an opportunity to cover the Bartiſons and Roofs of the Houſes with Earth; beſides that in the removal of the Regiſters, Letters and other things might be conveighed to and from the Duke, advantages which they were reſolved not to allow him. Till at length the Duke finding himſelf ſtraitned on every ſide, and having no hopes of relief, beſides that he deſtruſted the Souldiers in the Garriſon, and ſaw the Trenches of the Beſiegers advanced very near the Walls of the Caſtle, as alſo dreading the Mines which the beſiegers had ſunk under the Works, upon the 13th. of <hi>June</hi> beat a parley, and hung out a White flag; but the Officer who commanded in the Leaguer told him plainly, he would admit of no parley, unleſs it were to ſurrender the Caſtle, in regard he had ſo often deluded them with ſo many frivolous Treaties to no purpoſe. Upon which the Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he would ſurrender the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64970:46"/>Caſtle upon Honourable Terms; onely he deſired to know whither he muſt Treat with the Officer commanding in the Leaguer, or with his Grace the Lord Commiſſioner? This point being ſettled the Duke of <hi>Gourdon</hi> inſiſted to have an Honourable capitulation; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Commiſſioners were ſent up to Treat with him; but while they were debating together with the Duke upon the terms which he propounded, at firſt very high, and deemed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to be unreaſonable, a certain Perſon ran ſuddainly into the Caſtle du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Truce, and delivered ſeveral Letters to the Duke, as it was ſuppoſed from <hi>Dundee,</hi> or elſe the late King in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Commiſſioners being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this Action, require to have the Meſſenger delivered up to them; in regard that no man ought to have come into the Caſtle upon ſuch Errands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent. This the Duke refuſed to do; alledging, <hi>That ſince the Perſon came to him, he was obliged to protect him.</hi> Upon which the Treaty being broke off, the Garriſon fired both with their great and ſmall ſnot all that night upon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64970:46"/>the City it ſelf, and every other way where they imagined they could do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif: inſomuch that ſeveral perſons were killed, others wounded, and ſome Houſes were much prejudiced by the Cannon.</p>
            <p>But the next morning the Duke beat another Parley, and hung out a white Flag, ſo that Commiſſioners were again ſent to Treat with Him; and this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had ſo good an effect, that the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for the ſurrender of the Caſtle were agreed, and confirmed by the Privy Council; to the great joy and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all good and honeſt men, but to the great trouble and grief of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected party, who truſted much to this ſtrong place, as being thought impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>

            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:64970:47"/>
            <p>After theſe Articles were confirmed by the Privy Council, the Gariſon march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Hill before the Caſtle; where they laid down their Armes, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up the Keys of the Caſtle, many thouſands of people being got in heaps together to ſignifie their joy in loud ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and prayers for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and happineſs of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> as being now aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to live ſafely and quietly, and enjoy their Religion, Laws, Liberties and Properties during their proſperous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. At the ſame time Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers under the Command of Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Mackey</hi> and Major <hi>Somerville</hi> marched in and took poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Caſtle; which was ſtrangely battered and ruined during the Siege by reaſon of the great Execution that was done by the Bombs. It was ſaid, that there was ſome difference between the Duke of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> the Governour, and Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Windram,</hi> who was Deputy-Governour of the Caſtle; the Duke inclining to have delivered it up before, but <hi>Windram</hi> urging ſtill to hold it out. However at laſt the Duke and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64970:48"/>his party in the Gariſon prevailed, which haſtened the ſurrender. <hi>Windram</hi> in the hurry was endeavouring to have made his eſcape; but being diſcovered, was brought back to the Caſtle, for which he had no ſmall reaſon to bleſs his kind Stars for that if he ſhould have fallen into the hands of the Rabble, in all probability they would have torn him to pieces; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body looking upon him as the cauſe that the Caſtle held out ſo long, and of all the miſchiefs that hapned during the Seige. It was alſo reported, that the Duke of <hi>Gourdon</hi> after the ſurrender of the Caſtle, ſolemnly declared, that during the time of the Siege, he never received any Letter from the late King.</p>
            <p>During this Blokade and ſiege of the Caſtle, many affairs were tranſacted and brought to perfection in Order to the ſettlement of the Government. Among other things, the Convention appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Committee to draw up an Anſwer to the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Letter, which being done, and the draught of it being read and approved of by the Houſe, it was ſigned by all the Members that were preſent, except three Biſhops, the reſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64970:48"/>of the Biſhops having before withdrawn themſelves from the Convention. And as for ſome others that were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Duke of <hi>Queensbury,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of <hi>Athol,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Tweddale,</hi> deſired that the Letter might be ſent to their Lodgings to be ſigned, in regard their indiſpoſition of body would not permit them to come to the Houſe.</p>
            <p>But though the three Biſhops refuſed to approve of the Letter the day before, yet the next day they agreed that the Lord <hi>Roſs</hi> ſhould be the bearer of it, to preſent it to the King of <hi>England.</hi> At what time the Queſtion being put whi- Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> of <hi>Polwart,</hi> might be admitted a Member of the Houſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Attainder, the three Biſhops left the Houſe, ſo that after they had unanimouſly Voted that Sir <hi>Patrick</hi> was duly choſen, and ought to ſit as a Member of the Convention, the Houſe were forced to riſe that Night without prayers. This refuſal of the Biſhops to approve of the Letter occaſion ſome of the Members to call to mind a paſſage, when the Biſhops in the beginning of the Convention, vigorouſly oppoſed the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64970:49"/>Convention's approving of the Addreſs of the Nobility and Gentry at <hi>London</hi> to His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which one of the Members made this Obſervation: <hi>That it was no wonder the Biſhops oppoſed the approving the</hi> London Addreſs, <hi>and refuſed to ſign the Letter to the King of</hi> England, <hi>ſince the Houſe had been ſo unkind as not to approve of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops famous Addreſs to the late King</hi> James.</p>
            <p>The Paper being therefore agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without their conſent, the Lord <hi>Roſs</hi> was made choice of to deliver to the King. It was called an Anſwer of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Letter in theſe Words.</p>

            <p>This Anſwer being thus diſpatched away for <hi>England,</hi> the Convention judging it moſt neceſſary in the firſt place to ſecure the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt all attempts of the diſ-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Party and Favourers of the late Kings Arbitrary deſigns, gave order to Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> Mr. <hi>George Stirling,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Hamilton,</hi> or any two of them to ſee the Oath Adminiſtered to ſuch as had any Military office in and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64970:50"/>about <hi>Edinburough;</hi> and to bring in an Accompt of ſuch Arms as were in the ſeveral Garriſons. And whereas ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons were ſeen coming Arm'd from the Borders of <hi>England,</hi> therefore the reſpective Magiſtrates and Officers of the <hi>Militia</hi> in the Bordering Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ordered to ſeize ſuch perſons in Arms, until they gave a good accompt of their buſineſs; or if they could give no good accompt of themſelves, that the Magiſtrates or Officers who ſhould ſeize ſuch perſons, ſhould have their Horſes and Arms for their Reward.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time alſo they gave their approbation of an Order given by the Earl of <hi>Tweddale</hi> in <hi>January</hi> to <hi>William Drummond</hi> for the delivery of Forty barrels of Powder, to Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> Merchant of <hi>London-derry,</hi> for the uſe of the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered farther that the Preſident ſhould have power to diſpatch ſuch perſons as he ſhould judge neceſſary, either for <hi>Ireland,</hi> or ſuch other places as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent exigency of affairs required. Nor were they leſs vigilant in giving out their Commands for the ſecuring all ſuſpected
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64970:51"/>Perſons, and keeping of ſtrong Guards in Sea-port Towns, and at all the Bridges, Ferries and other Paſſes throughout the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>With theſe debates fell in at the ſame time, a long conſultation about giving Orders in reference to the <hi>Militia,</hi> which took up ſome time for the naming of Truſty Officers, and appointing places for the Muſters within the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and care was taken to provide that the Souldiers at thoſe Muſters ſhould continue ſix dayes together in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Arms; and after that ſhould be ready to march upon notice given with twenty days Proviſion.</p>
            <p>By this the month of <hi>March</hi> drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a concluſion, at what time the Preſident moved, that a Committee be named to conſider the State of the Government, and bring in their opinion for the ſettling of it. Which raiſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate whither the matter ſhould be firſt treated of in a Committee or not; which was carryed in the Affirmative.</p>

            <p>All which perſons were ſelected into this great Committee by the plurality of Fifty Four Voices, more then the fourth part of the Meeting.</p>
            <p>When the Preſident moved that this Committee might be named, and eight out of every State were adjudged a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of which ſix were then preſent, moved that they might have the Priviledge of a State: but they were anſwered, that that point
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64970:52"/>was over-ruled, and they muſt joyn with the Nobility. Then the Queſtion was mov'd, whither every one of theſe three Bodies or <hi>States,</hi> the Nobility, Knights and Burgeſſes ſhould diſtinctly chooſe their eight? but it was carried that every Member of the Houſe ſhould give in a Liſt of twenty four, being eight out of every State under their hands. and that thoſe that had the moſt Voices ſhould be choſen; which fell to be the Lot of the perſons above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſome other like ſtruglings of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> againſt the ſtream, and ſome other diſcontents which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention obſerv'd in their behaviour, were highly diſguſted by the generality of Eſtates, inſomuch that although they began to have ſuch a miſtruſt of them, that they made a particular Order, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in their Prayers ſhould not mention or inſinuate any thing againſt their Acts or Proceedings.</p>
            <p>And this diſguſt againſt the <hi>Biſhops</hi> was heightned by another accident which happened at the ſame time: for that while the Convention was Voting
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64970:52"/>Major General <hi>Mackay</hi> to be General, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> deſired, <hi>That all the Biſhops might be excus'd, in regard the Houſe was then upon a Military con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</hi> Upon which, one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſtood up and declared, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> had got a new ſight; but that he had ſeen Military Orders ſigned by the very ſame <hi>Biſhop.</hi> To which when the Archbiſhop replyed, that the Caſe was different, for that then he was Chairman of the Committee, the ſame Member made anſwer, <hi>That he knew no difference in the Cafe, but onely thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were then againſt Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Order in queſtion againſt Papiſts. And this was one reaſon, that they who retain'd a Great Reverence for the Order, yet had no kindneſs for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were then of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the 30th. of <hi>March,</hi> the Grand Committee of Twenty four, agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves the Throne to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, but came to a Concluſion in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. Some there were who ſeem'd to incline not to inſiſt ſo much upon the Head of Deſertion or Abdication, but on that of Male-Adminiſtration. Others
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64970:53"/>there were who ſeem'd deſirous that the Crown ſhould not be confirm'd by way of Tranſlation, but by ſucceſſion to the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to the King, in the Right of a Husband, only he to have the Adminſtration during life. Others were for conferring the Care with a Union of both Kingdoms. Others were firſt for ſettling the Crown, and then for treating of the Union. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this diverſity of Opinions, at length, the Earls of <hi>Tweddale</hi> and <hi>Calender,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hugh Brown</hi> being added to the Committee, they came to an Agreement, and it was referr'd to a Sub-Committee to draw up the Reaſons for the Vacancy, which being brought into the Grand Committee, the ſame were approv'd and paſs'd with a <hi>Nemine Contradicente.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Fourth of <hi>April</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for declaring the Throne vacant were read the laſt time in the Houſe in the following Terms.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>This Proclamation occaſioned the Deprivation of ſeveral Miniſters and the loſs of their Livings, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Commanding Authority. And ſo obſtinate they were in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy, that being cited before the

And thus among others they ſerved the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Boody,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that never had been at Conventicle in his Life, nor ever abſented himſelf
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64970:59"/>from his Pariſh Church, if in the Country and in health. Yet becauſe his Lady, who had labored long under a lingring diſeaſe which had brought her ſo low that ſhe could not ſtir abroad, was ſo unfortunate as not to be able to give her attendance at Divine Service, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by the Information and practiſes of the Neighbouring Clergy was fined in 2 Thouſand pound <hi>ſterling,</hi> almoſt to the ruine of his Affairs and Family: and part of the Fine as it was ſaid, beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Scotch Colledge</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi>

            <p>Nor was this diſlike of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Convention confined within the Clergy only; there were other Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents that were laying the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of new Commotions, by holding correſpondence with the late King in <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence they were in hopes of great Aſſiſtance. Theſe Machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were in part diſcovered, by the ſeizing of one <hi>Brady</hi> and <hi>Grenoch,</hi> near <hi>Glaſgow</hi> in his return from <hi>Ireland.</hi> About him were taken ſeveral Letters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writings; more particularly one Letter from the late King, and another from the E. of <hi>Melfort</hi> to Viſcount <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:64970:59"/>and the E. of <hi>Belcarris,</hi> referring to Letters formerly Written by them, and ſent by one Sir <hi>Kennedy.</hi> The ſubſtance of the Letters were, That the late King had forty Thouſand men in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he would ſpeedily be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſend them a formidable Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; that in the mean time he could ſpare them five thouſand foot, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and a hundred Dragoons, deſiring them withal to ſend an exact accompt of the Countrey, and how the Gentry and people ſtood affected. He alſo farther required them to ſummon together as many of the Biſhops and Burgeſſes as they could, to hold a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in his Name. As for <hi>Melfort</hi> he was very crank in the Letters telling his Friends, that he hoped to be merry with them once more in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to have his loſſes repaired out of the Eſtates of <hi>Forefaulters;</hi> and declared that he would deſtroy all the Members of the <hi>Convention;</hi> but as for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, he was reſolved to make them <hi>Gibeonites, Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water,</hi> for the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> the only <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed.

            <p>Therefore for the redreſs of all Grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and for the amending, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and preſerving the Laws, they claim'd that Parliaments ought to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

            <p>The Oath was but ſhort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to that which was preſcrib'd in <hi>England.</hi>

               <hi>That at his coming from</hi> Holland, <hi>he had a particular regard to</hi> Scotland, <hi>and had emitted a Declaration for that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well as for</hi> England, <hi>which he would make effectual to them.

            </p>
            <p>The latter part of theſe words are ſomewhat alter'd in another Relation of this Important Ceremony, though much to the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they ſhould find him Willing to aſſiſt them in every thing that concern'd the Weal of that kingdom; by making what Laws ſhould be neceſſary for the ſecurity of their Religion, Property and Liberty, and to eaſe them of what might be juſtly grievous to them.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We</hi> William <hi>and</hi> Mary, <hi>King and Queen of</hi> Scotland, <hi>faithfully promiſe and ſwear by this our Solemn Oath in preſence of the Eternal God, that during the whole Courſe of our Life, we will ſerve the ſame Eternal God to the uttermoſt of our Power, according as he has required in his moſt Holy Word, reveal'd and contain'd in the New and Old Teſtament; and according to the ſame Word ſhall maintain the True Religion of</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>the Preaching of his Holy Word, and the due and Right Miniſtration of the Sacraments, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and preach'd within the Realm of</hi> Scotland; <hi>and ſhall aboliſh and gain-ſtand all falſe Religion contrary to the ſame; and ſhall rule the People committed to our Charge, according to the Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, revealed in his above ſaid

            </p>
            <p>True it is, that the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> had authorized their Commiſſioners to

Many reaſons were urg'd on both ſides; but in regard that they who were for the Addreſs deliver'd, prevail'd, the Reaſons on that ſide were onely made publick: By which it was alledg'd, That becauſe that the preſent Meeting of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> being aſſembled in a way wholly extraordinary, for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion, and re-eſtabliſhing the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom; and they having declar'd the Throne Vacant, and having alſo lately conferr'd and ſettl'd the Crown upon King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument made for that effect, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe agreed upon the Grievances which they expect to be redreſs'd, they ought to be turn'd into a Parliament for the Reaſons following. Firſt,</p>
            <p>Becauſe the turning of the <hi>Meeting</hi> into a Parliament, was abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for attaining the Ends for which it was call'd; it being evident, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Eſtates had indeed happily laid the Foundations by the ſettlement
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64970:73"/>they had made, yet both the perfecting the Claim of Right, and the redreſſing the Greivances complain'd of, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably require a Parliament; and by the ſame Argument of Neceſſity, the turning of the ſame Meeting into a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; in regard the perfecting of that begun work was not to be expected from other hands, nor could they in their Circumſtances look for it with any probability. So that unleſs the States would incur the Cenſure, <hi>of beginning to build, but not being able to finiſh,</hi> they could not leave the work unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe their preſent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were manifeſtly ſuch, as neither did admit of the delay of calling a new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, nor indeed did allow them to hope that new Parliament would perfect the Work begun; the imminent threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an Invaſion from <hi>Ireland</hi> with the Jealouſies and Diſtractions within the Kingdom, being Arguments too palpable to refute the Conceit of calling a new Parliament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe they had the practiſe of <hi>England</hi> for a good Preſident, and as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64970:73"/>plain neceſſity and Reaſon had hitherto oblig'd the Convention to tread in their Footſteps; ſo thoſe Motives were at preſent moſt cogent for their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>To this it was objected that the thing could not be done by Law, ſeeing the Eſtates aſſembled in their own Right, from abſolute neceſſity; and having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſettl'd and ſurrender'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; they were defunct and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd; and the King could no more turn the <hi>Meeting</hi> into a Parliament, than he could at another time conſtitute a <hi>meeting</hi> of Men to be a Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a lawful Summons and the Peoples Choice: And moreover, That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Shires and Burroughs have onely their Commiſſions in the Meeting of the Eſtates and not in a Parliament. And as for the Caſe of <hi>England,</hi> that they had Preſidents, but <hi>Scotland</hi> had none.</p>
            <p>To all which it was anſwer'd, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the laſt part firſt, That <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had <hi>Englands</hi> practiſe for a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but that <hi>England</hi> it ſelf had no
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64970:74"/>Preſident, unleſs that of 1660. the lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that ever was heard of; for that, there having been a Meeting call'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King, and conſiſting only of a Houſe of Commons, when the King returned he added to it the Houſe of Peers, and turned it into a Houſe of Peers without any Summons or other Formality. And ſuppoſing that <hi>England</hi> might now alledge that for a Preſident, yet that Parliament, 1660. had no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it was true, that the <hi>Eſtates</hi> by the ſurrender and ſettlement were defunct, at leaſt as to that point: Yet what could poſſibly hinder, why the <hi>Eſtates</hi> who had made ſo great a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, That for to make all the work effectual, King <hi>William</hi> ſhould preſently turn the Meeting into a Parliament: For that certainly if the <hi>Eſtates</hi> had power (as no doubt they had) to mould and confer the Government, as they had done, they had power to do this alſo, and indeed that they could not do it without a viſible neglect, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as yet neither the Inſtrument nor the Commiſſioners were diſpatched.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:64970:74"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Though this ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet the ſame reaſon of State, and invincible Neceſſity, the principal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all their late proceedings, did with the ſame force and Evidence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that the <hi>Meeting</hi> ſhould be turn'd into a Parliament.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That their could be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect alledged for the Commiſſions for Shires and Burroughs, but what would more ſtrengthen the Argument againſt what was already done, than againſt what was craved to be done. But that in truth, the Commiſſions were full enough beyond all exception.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, There could be no Treaty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> without a Commiſſion from King and Parliament: So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Treaty were turned into a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Treaty muſt for a long time be delay'd and poſtpon'd.</p>
            <p>By the event it was evident that theſe Reaſons overcame all Obſtructions in this Affair: for that within a few days after their Majeſties had taken the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oath, the King declared his pleaſure for turning the Meeting of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates</hi> into a Parliament, and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64970:75"/>the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, upon the laſt day of <hi>May</hi> ſign'd his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>And in regard that upon Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Acceptance of the Crown, all Commiſſions, Gifts and other Writs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by the King were of neceſſity to be docketed and counterſigned by the Secretary of State, the King made choice of the Lord <hi>Melvil</hi> for that Office, as being a Perſon that could never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to act in the former Raigns. And in regard it was as neceſſary for him to have an Advocate, he named Sir <hi>John Dalrimple,</hi> one of three Commiſſioners for offer of the Crown, to that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>Moreover becauſe as King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was no leſs requiſite for him to have a ſtanding Privy Council, His Majeſty made choice of the following Perſons to act in that High Station.</p>

            <p>The Privy Council thus choſen made it their firſt buſineſs to take care for the preſervation of the Kingdom; for the diſturbance of which they had Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeveral Machinations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies. Inſomuch that about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>June</hi> the Lord <hi>Tarbot</hi>'s Son
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64970:76"/>was ſeiz'd, the Lord <hi>Levar,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Dunmore</hi> committed to Cuſtody, with ſome Ladies alſo of Quality. But while the Privy Council were thus prying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecrets of theſe dark deſigns, not being able to make any perfect diſcovery, fifteen Men and two Women iſſued out of the Caſtle of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> at that time not ſurrendred, the Men having their Muskets Cockt and well charg'd with a brace of Bullets. But they were all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Guards that blockt up the Caſtle, except one Woman, that eſcap'd through the <hi>Noreloch,</hi> and brought to the Duke of <hi>Hamilton.</hi> About the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man there was taken a <hi>Pacquet</hi> of Letters, with many Keys, and particularly the Keys of the outer Gate of the Caſtle, and the Key of the Poſtern Gate. Soon after the Woman that made her eſcape was alſo taken with a great many more Letters. This ſeaſonable diſcovery was of great Importance. For thereby the Council came to underſtand who they were that were moſt deeply concern'd in the deſigns on foot for overturning the Government, and the Methods and Inſtruments they made uſe of to bring
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64970:76"/>it to paſs. Among the reſt it was found out that many belonging to the Law were concerned and ſeveral of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that refuſed to pray for the King and the Queen. Among the Ladies, the Counteſs Dowager of <hi>Arrol</hi> was ſeized and brought up a Priſoner to <hi>Edinbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> and committed upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A certain Meſſenger going in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe like a Beggar to Viſcount <hi>Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s Houſe, with a bag of Meal upon his Shoulders, after he had paſſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Centinels, was at laſt ſtopped by one, who putting his hand into the Bag among the Meal, found ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the ſum of fifteen pound <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> in Gold. Thoſe Letters diſcovered the Correſpondent, and her Orders for the diſtribution of the Gold among <hi>Dundee</hi>'s Officers: So that the Lady and the Gold were ſent up to the Council, who committed the Counteſs to priſon, and ordered the Gold to be employed for the Service of King <hi>William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe Tranſactions of the Council, upon the 5th. of <hi>June,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> acquainted the <hi>States</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:64970:77"/>with his having a Commiſſion ſent him from the King, to repreſent His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties perſon in the firſt Seſſions of the Approaching Parliament, and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that particular briefly thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That His Majeſty had been pleaſed to ſend him a Commiſſion to repreſent his Royal Perſon in the firſt Seſſion; which he acknowledged to be an Honour far above what he deſerved, eſpecially at ſuch a time when the Importance and Condition of His Majeſties Affairs in the Kingdom of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>required the Greateſt Truſt from his Majeſties, and the greateſt Faithfulneſs and Ability in his Commiſſioner, which were otherwiſe neceſſary in ſo high a Station. And that although the ſhort advertiſement of his Majeſties Pleaſure therein, might give him ſome difficulty in diſcharging the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties incumbent on a perſon in that High Character; yet ſuch was the Zeal he had for His Majeſties Service, and the Good of his Country, that he reſolved to give all ready and chearful Obedience to His Majeſties Commands, and to omit nothing in his Power that might advance
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64970:77"/>His Honour and Intereſt, or contribute to the Peace and Security of the Nation. That he had received His Majeſties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for turning the Meeting into a Parliament, and then to adjourn the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to the ſeventeenth of</hi> June, <hi>and after that to conſent to the enacting of ſuch Laws as might not onely redreſs the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Articles of the Grievances, but to any other Acts, which they ſhould adviſe for ſecuring the Religion, Peace, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke having thus delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Kings Commiſſion was read, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Letter from His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, declaring His pleaſure to turn them into a Parliament: Which being done, the Commiſſioner acquainted the Eſtates with the Kings farther pleaſure, that the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> ſhould preſide in the enſuing Seſſion of his firſt Parliament. Upon which, the Earl came from the Lords Bench to the Preſidents Seat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne, and made a Speech to the Eſtates, and then moved that the Act for turning the Meeting into a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament might be forthwith drawn. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64970:78"/>which the Commiſſioner named the Earl of <hi>Lowthian,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Torbat,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Ormiſton,</hi> Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> of <hi>Polwart,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>David Spence,</hi> to be of a Committee for drawing up the Act; who thereupon preſently withdrawing into the Inner Houſe, after a little time returned with the Act drawn up accordingly; which being read and debated, was without delay both voted and approved, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King and Queens Majeſties with Advice and Conſent of the Eſtates of this Kingdom at preſent aſſembled, Enact and Declare, That the three Eſtates now met together the Fifth of</hi> June, 1689. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the Noblemen, Barons and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, are a Lawful and Free Parliament, and are hereby declared, enacted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be ſuch, and to all intents and purpoſes whatſoever, notwithſtanding the want of any new Writs or Proclamation for calling the ſame or the want of any other Solemnity. And that all Acts and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to be paſſed therein ſhall be received, acknowledged and obeyed by the Subjects as Acts of Parliament and Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64970:78"/>And it is hereby declared, That it ſhall be High Treaſon for any Perſons to diſown, quarrel or impugn the Dignity and Authority of this Parliament, upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Act being thus paſſed, and at the ſame time touch'd with the Scepter, the Preſident, by Command of the High Commiſſioner adjourned the Parliament to the Seventeenth of <hi>June,</hi> being Twelve dayes.</p>
            <p>Upon the Seventeenth of <hi>June</hi> the Parliament met, at what time the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner having ordered the Honours to be ſent for from the Caſtle, Knighted Mr. <hi>William Hamilton</hi> Advocate, and a Member of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>After which the Commiſſioner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Parliament, That he had Inſtructions from their Majeſties, about redreſſing the Greivance of the Lords of the Articles, as formerly conſtituted; and that their Majeſties had ordered him to condeſcend to the paſſing an Act for chuſing Eight out of every E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, Lords, Barons and Burgeſſes, which with the Officers of State ſhould
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64970:79"/>prepare Things for the Parliament. And that it ſhould be always in the Power of the Parliament, even of thoſe things which the Committee ſhould report, if they ſhould think ſit ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Thereupon an Act being drawn to that purpoſe, it was preſented by the Commiſſioner to the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> Preſident of the Parliament; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave it to the Clerks deliver'd himſelf to this Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That in regard they were now in another Station than they were formerly, that is to ſay, the Supreme Court of the Kingdom, and ſo happy in a Prince who preferr'd the juſt Rights and Intereſts of his people to his own Prerogative, and who crav'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them but what would make them happy, That they ſhould lay aſide all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities and private differencies, and make the Publick Good the only motive and end of their Actings; which Things as they were always neceſſary, ſo eſpecially at that Juncture, when they had Religion, the Government of the Church, and the Juſt Rights of the Subject to Eſtabliſh, and Greivances to Redreſs: That Chriſtianity
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64970:79"/>taught Verity, the King crav'd, and the preſent Juncture made it indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and Gods bleſſing always attended it. That the King had put it fully into their power to make ſuch Laws as might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to them their Religion and Properties; wherein if they failed it would be their own fault; that the Eyes of their Enemies were upon them, waiting for their halting; and that nothing could encourage or ſtrengthen them more then Animoſities and Diviſions among themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Preſident having thus ſpoken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Act to be Read. But then it was mov'd by the Lord <hi>Roſs,</hi> that before they went about to conſider or Vote any Act, that they ſhould all Swear and Subſcribe the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and that an Act ſhould be made to that Intent. Which motion being approv'd, the Lord <hi>Roſs</hi> gave in the following draught of an Act in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of what he had mov'd.</p>
            <p>That the Eſtate of Parliament conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Their Majeſties had accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tender of the Crown of this Realm made to them, and had taken the Oath appointed to be taken by all Kings and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64970:80"/>Queens of this Kingdom; therefore They with the conſent of Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties did Declare, Recognize and Aſſert Their Royal Authority and Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And Ordered all the Members and Clerks of Parliament, and all other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that at preſent are in, or ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be called hereafter to any place of publick Truſt Civil and Military to Swear and Subſcribe the Oath hereto ſubjoyned. And they hereby diſcharge and annual all former Acts of Parliament appointing any other Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Supremacy, Declarations, Teſts, or Other publick Oaths whatever, to be taken by them henceforward, ſo as they appoint the ſame to be taken, except the Oath, <hi>de Fideli Adminiſtratione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Oath ſubjoyned was this,</p>
            <p>I A. B. <hi>Do Solemnly Swear in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, That I ſhall bear Faith and True Allegiance to King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So help me God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:64970:80"/>
            <p>This Act paſſed <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> only that the Earl of <hi>Kincairden</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew; ſo that being thus paſſed and touched with the Scepter, all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that were preſent took the Oath with uplifted hands; and then the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident adminiſtred it to the Clerks; and the next day they all ſubſcribed it.</p>
            <p>It was at the ſame time mov'd by the Earl of <hi>Caſſils,</hi> that all the Clergy ſhould take the ſame Oath; but that was wav'd, till it were farther conſidered what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons, or whither all in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould take the ſame; and ſo that debate being laid aſide, they all took the other Oath <hi>de Fideli Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, being the eighteenth of <hi>June,</hi> the whole Houſe ſubſcribed the Oath; and ſuch of the Members who were abſent the day before, both ſwore and ſubſcribed it alſo. Which done they proceeded to Read the Act for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the Grievance of the Lords of the Articles, which appointed a conſtant Committee of Eight Perſons out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Eſtate,</hi> with the Officers of ſtate, to be in place of the Lords of the Articles.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64970:81"/>But this firſt draught of the Act did no way pleaſe the Generality of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; inſomuch that upon the 25th. of <hi>June,</hi> the draught of the Act was again preſented, and read with an Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees ſhould be choſen by the Reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Eſtates; the <hi>Noblemen</hi> out of the <hi>Nobility;</hi> the <hi>Barons</hi> from among the <hi>Barons;</hi> and the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> by the <hi>Burgeſs Eſtate.</hi> Which being agreed to, they came to a new debate, <hi>Whither the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State ſhould be ſupernumerary in thoſe Committees?</hi> and after much argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Queſtion being put to the Vote it was carryed in the Negative; and a Clauſe ordered to be added to the Act; Declaring, <hi>That the Officers of State were not to be Members of the Committees, unleſs they ſhould be choſen.</hi> With which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Act was again Read, Voted and Approved, in the following terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forasmuch as the</hi> Meeting <hi>of the Eſtates of this Kingdom did by their Vote of the Seventh of</hi> April <hi>laſt, repreſent among other Grievances, that the Committee of Parliament, called the</hi> Articles, <hi>was and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64970:81"/>is a great Grievance to the Nation, and that there ought to be no Committees of Parliament, but ſuch as are freely choſen by the Eſtates to prepare motions and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are firſt tabled in the Houſe. Therefore Their Majeſties with the Adviſe and Conſent of the Eſtates in Parliament do Enact and Declare, That it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Priviledge of the three Eſtates in Parliament to nominate and appoint Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of Parliament of what number of Members they pleaſe, being equal of every Eſtate, and choſen by the reſpective Eſtates; viz. The Noblemen by the Eſtate of the Noblemen; the Barons by the Eſtate of the Barons; and the Burghers by the Eſtate of the Buroughs, for preparing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Overtures that are firſt made in the Houſe; or that the Houſe may treat, Vote and Conclude upon matters brought in plain Parliament, without remitting them to any Committee if they think fit: Or that the Houſe may appoint plurality of Committees for Motions and Overtures that need to be prepared or digeſted for them. Declaring hereby, That no Officers of State are to be Members except they be choſen. And hereby reſcinding the firſt Act of the third
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64970:82"/>Seſſion of the firſt Parliament of King</hi> Charles the ſecond, <hi>and all other Lawes and Cuſtoms eſtabliſhing the manner of Election and Power of any Committees of Parliament, ſo far as they are not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to this Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when this Act was offered to be touched by the Scepter, the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner ſignified to the Houſe that their Vote not being in the terms of the Inſtrument which he had received from the King, he could not give the Royal Aſſent thereto, until he had acquainted His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>For the firſt Inſtructions to the High Commiſſioner were in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are to paſs an Act for regulating the Articles to conſiſt of twenty four perſons, beſides the Officers of State, whereof Eight are to be choſen by the Noblemen out of their Eſtate, Eight by the Barons, and Eight by the Burroughs out of their Eſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Conceſſion was not thought ſufficient, and it ſo much the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, becauſe it was looked upon as a delay, to the ſatisfying the People in the firſt and moſt important Grievance,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64970:82"/>for the redreſs of which they had ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſtipulated with His Majeſty. It was urged that by the ancient Records of ſeveral Parliaments it appeared, that the Officers of State were ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupernumerary in the Committees of the Articles, that they were not ſo much as Elected into that truſt, nor had any room allowed them there: though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the ſame Records, that there were Members choſen by and out of the reſpective Eſtates, ſometimes in larger, ſometimes in leſſer numbers to conſtitute ſuch Eſtates: And although after the year 1567. Some of the Officers of State were now &amp; then by reaſon of their great Abilities, thought fit to be choſen among others for Lords of the <hi>Articles,</hi> yet they were not Elected into thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees by vertue of their Offices, much leſs that they ſate there as perſons ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary to thoſe that were choſen. Beſides that in the 37 Act, in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of <hi>James</hi> the ſixth, where proviſion was made for the number of thoſe that were to conſtitute this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, it was only Enacted, that the number of the Lords of the <hi>Articles</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:64970:83"/>ſhould equal in each Eſtate, and that the feweſt out of each Eſtate ſhould be ſix, and the greateſt number not above Ten. This was the ſtate of the Court of Articles, as being conſtituted at firſt for the eaſe of the Parliament, in the diſpatch of buſineſs, till through the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations of the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after their ſucceſſion to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the removal of their Royal Reſidence thither, and through the officiouſneſs of publick Miniſters to the Prince, and their Treachery to their Countrey, it grew up at length to that exorbitancy, that it became not only burthenſom but intollerable. For by reaſon of the Parliaments coming at laſt to commit the inſpection into all affairs, and preparing all remedies for Greivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the hands of a few, and thoſe unchangeable during a whole Seſſion, the late Monarchs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> obtained ſuch an opportunity to incroach upon the Juriſdiction of Parliaments and the Liberties of the People, that they ſoon improved it to the eluding all the good that the Kingdom was to expect from Parliaments, and making thoſe that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64970:83"/>were deſign'd to be the means of the peoples ſafety, the inſtruments of their ruin. For the accompliſhment of which and the more eaſie rendring the Lords of the <hi>Articles</hi> Vaſſals to the Monarchs will, and tools for executing his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they firſt prevailed to have the Officers of State admitted into this Committees as ſupernumerary, without being nominated and elected by the Eſtates in Parliament, as having a right to ſit there by vertue of their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Adulation of the Engliſh brought over intirely to their intereſt, as well as to their Opinions, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mind to obtrude upon the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ceremonies, in order to the more eaſie effecting it, ſo wrought with the Parliament in the year 1617. part by fair, and part by fowl means, that he brought them to allow the Officers of ſtate to ſit as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeraries without being choſen into the Committee. And by that means he forc'd thoſe Innovations commonly known by the name of the five Articles of <hi>Pearth,</hi> upon the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:64970:84"/>having by thoſe Supernumerary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, not only ſo moulded the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of <hi>Articles,</hi> as to paſs and preſent them, but thereby laid the Foundation of their being enacted in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the antient Method of Elections of that Committee. For whereas by ancient Law and Cuſtom, the Lords were to Elect the Lords, the Barons to chuſe Barons, and the Burghers the Burghers, he in his Parliament, 1633. aſſumed a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to himſelf, with a right of conſigning it over to his Commiſſioner, to chooſe eight Biſhops, whom he empowred to chooſe eight Noblemen, reſtraining to the ſaid Eight Noblemen and Biſhops the power of chooſing eight Barons and as many Burghers, which together with the Officers of State as Supernumeraries were to be the ſole Lords of the <hi>Articles,</hi> excluſive of all others; and in theſe was veſted the ſole Right and Liberty of bringing in all Motions and Overtures for redreſſing of Wrongs, and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing means and expedients for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and benefit of the Subject. Neither was it by the practice of the late Raigns
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64970:84"/>lawful for any Members that were not of that packt Cabal, to make the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal or Motion for the repealing of an ill Law, or the enacting of a good one.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon therefore it was that the Convention repreſented to the King this Committee of Articles ſo great a Grievance to the Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that they inſiſted ſo earneſtly for ejecting the Supernumerary Officers of State out of it, unleſs legally and fairly Choſen. And ſome there were who urg'd that the very contending for the Officers of State to ſit as Supernumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in their Committees, without being elected into them by the Eſtates in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was both an Aſperſion upon the Wiſdom of the Parliament, as if they knew not how to pay the reſpect &amp; reverence due to thoſe Officers, till compell'd to it, and a Reflection upon their Loyalty, as if no perſon could be tender of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Intereſt among the Committees of Parliament, unleſs under the Influence of Honours and Emoluments.</p>
            <p>The Parliament therefore having heard the Commiſſioners plea for not paſſing the Act with their Amendments,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64970:85"/>ordered their Reaſons for the paſſing it in that Manner to be put in Writing, and the draught of a Letter to be ſent to His Majeſty together with their Reaſons, to be prepar'd and brought into the Houſe by the Committee for Redreſs of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, which being done accordingly both the one and the other were read and approved with ſome little alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo diſpatch'd away for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty having received the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and weigh'd the Reaſons, was pleaſed to give new Orders to his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner.</hi> So that upon the Ninth of <hi>July</hi> his <hi>Grace</hi> gave into the Houſe a Letter to the Parliament, with the draught of an Act for regulating the <hi>Articles</hi> in the terms of his Inſtructions in reference to that Grievance, by which he was impowred to increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from Eight to Eleven out of every <hi>Eſtate,</hi> beſides the Supernumerary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State; and allowing the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Elect them every Month, or oftner as they thought fit; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of any Matter in Parliament tho' rejected in the <hi>Articles:</hi> as deeming that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64970:85"/>ſince the Committee was now no more a conſtant Committee, he had ſecur'd the Parliament from believing they could be packt or taken off by the Court; and that the number being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, from twenty four to thirty three, he had removed all fears that eight Men could over-rule three and thirty. But the Parliament adherred to their firſt draught; and therefore falling into the debate of the laſt draught given in by the Committee, they read their own and that together, and ſtated the differences between both. But could come to no reſolution that day.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 10th. of <hi>July,</hi> the Commiſſioner, hoping to put them off from the further purſuit of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, moved, that the ſettling Church Government, and the Forfeitures might be taken into Conſideration; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ſome of the Members preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved, That the Affair of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees might be firſt adjuſted; upon which a debate aroſe which continued for ſome time. For by this ſome jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies aroſe in the Houſe, as if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners had not gone according to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64970:86"/>their Inſtructions in the delivery of the Inſtrument of Government to the King. Which cauſed the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> to make a requeſt to the Houſe, That in regard he had been a Commiſſioner to make the Offer of the Crown to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, and had accordingly acquitted himſelf of his Commiſſion, but was then commanded into the Service of Their Majeſties againſt the Rebels, and knew not when he ſhould return, therefore that the Parliament would declare their Approbation of what he had done in the Execution of his Commiſſion. But then it was moved, that before any ſuch Approbation, a paper might be read, containing certain Interrogatories to be put to the Commiſſioners who were ſent with the Tender of the Crown. Upon which it was ordered, That the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions given in to thoſe Commiſſioners ſhould be interrogated upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Inſtructions, or upon the Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories then given in. But before the point could be determined, the High Commiſſioner ordered an Adjournment till the next day. In the Interim a great Diſcovery was made publick of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64970:86"/>Conſpiracy diſclos'd in a Letter bearing date the Sixth of <hi>July,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the High Commiſſioner, from one that ſubſcribed his name in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters purporting.</p>
            <p>That the ſame Night about Six of the Clock, he was inform'd of certain ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined Perſons, who aſſuredly deſigned ſome wicked Enterprize, what it was he knew not; but that the particular Perſons of which he had undoubted Intimation were <hi>Winſter, Scot, Dunbar</hi> at <hi>Leith, Innes,</hi> one <hi>Telſter,</hi> one <hi>Wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whart,</hi> with many others, as by a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Paper which ſome of them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about them would appear. That there was one Colonel <hi>Wilſon, Butler,</hi> and <hi>Dunbar,</hi> with ſome other <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers lurking in <hi>Edinborough</hi> in <hi>Black frier Wine,</hi> as alſo Captain <hi>Dowglaſs, Kelheads</hi> Brother, <hi>Lees Pringle,</hi> and ſeveral others of which he was ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed. With which he thought it his duty in Conſcience to acquaint his Grace. That they intended to put their deſign in Execution within a day or two at fartheſt. He deſired his Grace not to deſpiſe his Advertiſement, aſſuring him
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64970:87"/>it was no ſtory, as if neglected would be too ſadly experienced. That he was almoſt engaged himſelf, by which means he came to underſtand the Truth, and left the whole to the Care of his Grace's wiſe Determination.</p>

            <p>With ſeveral others Officers, Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Tradeſmen of leſſer note, to the number of Eight and Thirty in all. It was given out at firſt that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to have ſeiz'd the Commiſſioner
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64970:87"/>and Members of Parliament, and to have ſet the City on Fire: but by their Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and Confeſſions it did not appear that they had any farther deſign then to have entered into an Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to go and joyn with <hi>Dundee.</hi> But let their deſign be what it would, the detection was conſiderable, whereby ſo many deſperate people were ſecured from doing miſchief, and the enemy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of their ſuccour. Nor is it to be wondered that ſuch dark contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances ſhould be ſo many times as they are, ſo ſtrangely diſcovered, ſeeing there is a fate hangs over the Head of all thoſe that conſpire againſt Lawful and Juſt Authority.</p>
            <p>This ſhort Commotion being over, the Parliament met the next day being the Eleventh of <hi>July,</hi> at what time His Majeſties Commiſſioner moved again, <hi>That Church Government might be taken into Conſideration.</hi> To which ſome of the Members reply'd, <hi>That the State of the Nation was firſt to be ſettled, as being that which would be a means to ſettle the other.</hi> And ſo they entered again upon the Officers of State, whither to be of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64970:88"/>the Committee or No? which debate continued long, but before it came to a reſult, the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> mov'd again for an Act of Exoneration of His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: adding withall, that he was willing to undergo the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny and examination that could be made. Upon which it was urged by a Noble Member of the Houſe, That if ſuch an Exoneration were deſired by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned in that affair, he might have the Liberty to propoſe ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories to the Commiſſioners before the Act of Exoneration paſt. Upon that Motion His <hi>Grace</hi> deſired firſt to ſee the Interrogatories, and that the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which were given the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners might be Read. Which being agreed to, His <hi>Grace</hi> made another Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That they might be interrogated upon their inſtructions and no farther. But then it was urg'd by ſome of the Houſe that the interrogatories might be read; which was granted. Upon which his <hi>Grace</hi> made a third Motion, that they might be asked whether they had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the claim or Petition of Right, and other Papers in the ſame order and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64970:88"/>method which the Eſtates had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? To that the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Exoneration which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired was only for himſelf; and that he was willing to anſwer any proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories that could be made to him on that head.</p>
            <p>But then it was, that the Kings Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate apprehending that the Motion aimed at him, offered to acquit and clear himſelf of any thing that might be charged upon him, as if he had not acted according to his Inſtructions, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion given them by the Eſtates. Others inſiſted, that he might be interrogated upon the Inſtructions given to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsoners. To which the Advocate made Anſwer, That he had no reaſon to decline being interrogated upon thoſe Inſtructions; in regard that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion granted to them being their Warrant, if he had acted according to that, he had ſufficiently diſcharged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Truſt, by that Commiſsion repoſed in him. But the debate conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo long upon this point, that the farther diſpute of it was adjourned till the next day.</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:64970:89"/>
            <p>Upon the twelfth of <hi>July</hi> the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> mov'd again that he might have his Exoneration concerning his faithful diſcharge of his Commiſsion. Upon which it being urg'd, that the interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, that had been given in the laſt day to be put to the Commiſsioners from the Convention might be Read, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was alledged, that ſome of them had adviſed the preſenting the Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces after their Majeſties had taken the Oath, contrary to the order of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. But then the Commiſsioner put in again, and renewed his Motion to the Houſe for taking the buſineſs of the Church Government into their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, precedent to any other matter, as His Majeſty had been pleaſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to them in his Gracious Letter. On the other ſide, the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that his Exoneration might take place, in regard it had been firſt brought before the Houſe, and conſequently ought to be firſt diſpatched. This point was inſiſted upon and argued by ſeveral Members; and at length the queſtion being put, Whether Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or the faithfulneſs and diligence of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64970:89"/>the Commiſsioners ſhould be firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? It was carryed by the plurality of Voices, that the Houſe ſhould firſt proceed to conſider of the Latter.</p>
            <p>It was then mov'd, that the three Commiſsioners ſhould withdraw out of the Houſe, and each of them ſhould be called in, and examined ſeparately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſcharge of their truſt, which was agreed to; and after much debate upon the method and manner of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, the Inſtructions were ordered to be read again, together with the Act of the late Convention, empowring them to tender the Crown. Which being done the debate was reſum'd; at what time it was urged in behalf of the Lord <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> that the Commiſsion to the three did bear, That they ſhould deliver the <hi>Petition of Right, and ſee the Oath taken, and declare the Grievances;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Order and Method which the <hi>Advocate</hi> had adviſed them to follow.</p>
            <p>To which it was anſwered on the other ſide, that the Inſtructions directed them to deliver both the Petition of Right and the Grievances before the Oath. But after much debate before
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64970:90"/>they came to any reſolution upon the matter, the Commiſſioner ordered the Houſe to be adjourned till the 17th. of <hi>July,</hi> nor was any more done in this affair, that we find during this Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>For the next day the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> having obtained his Commiſſion for Fire and Sword againſt all that adher'd to <hi>Dundee,</hi> or would not joyn with him in the common defence of the Country, to ſecure it from the irruptions of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> began his journey Weſtward; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying along with him ſome Troops of Horſe and ſeveral Detachments to joyn his own men and Followers, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others in that Countrey which were in a readineſs to come into him upon his appearing in thoſe parts, to ſecure the Weſtern Coaſts, in caſe of any invaſion from <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any other Inſurrections or Commotions on that ſide the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>Having therefore thus proſecuted in a continued ſeries this ſame ſtiffly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted buſineſs of the Committees as far as it would go, we muſt now return back for accompt of ſeveral other tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64970:90"/>both before as well as during this contention and after it was over.</p>
            <p>Before there was nothing elſe done, but after the Parliament had ſent away their Reaſons and their Letter in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the buſineſs of ſupernumerary Officers, the draught of an Act was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the Houſe and read, that no perſons who were imployed in the late Government and were grievous to the Nation, or had ſhown their diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the happy Change, or had been Retarders or Obſtructers of the good deſigns of the late <hi>Meeting,</hi> ſhould be allowed to poſſeſs, or be admitted to any publick Truſt, Place or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any kind under their Majeſties within that Kingdom. But this Act like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe being brought in the 26th. of <hi>June,</hi> met with ſeveral Remora's occaſioned by certain clauſes, which ſome thought required explanation. <hi>Perſons who had</hi> onely <hi>ſhewn diſſatisfaction,</hi> was thought too comprehenſive and ſevere. <hi>Thoſe who had been obſtructers and Retarders of the Good deſign of the Eſtates,</hi> was deemed too liable to bad conſtruction. And there were exceptions taken at the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64970:91"/>words <hi>Grievous to the Nation,</hi> as being too reſtrictive, without a farther inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. But at length upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>July,</hi> Explanations being added in the Statutory part to every of the clauſes excepted againſt the Act was brought in and paſſed in the terms that follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King and Queens Majeſty, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Eſtates of this Kingdom, have by their Vote declared their ſence and opinion, that ſuch have in the former evil Government been grievous to the Nation or have ſhewn diſaffection to the happy Change by the bleſſing God now brought about; or have been Retarders or Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the good deſigns of the ſaid Eſtates in their Meeting, are not fit to be employed in the management of the Affairs of this Kingdom, do with the Advice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Eſtates in Parliament now Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, Statute and Ordain, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of whatſoever rank or degree, who in the ſaid former evil Government have been grievous to the Nation, by acting in the incroachments mentioned in the Articles of the Claim of Right, which are declared to be contrary to Law; or have ſhown diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64970:91"/>affection to the happy Change by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God now brought about, by acting in oppoſition thereunto, ſince the time that the King and Queen now raigning were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd; or who has been a Retarder or or Obſtructor of the good deſigns of the ſaid Eſtates,</hi> viz. <hi>The ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion, the ſettling the Crown, the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Rights of the Leiges, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing their Grievances, by acting contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the good deſigns, ſince the time they became publick by Votes and Acts of the</hi> Meeting, <hi>be allowed to poſſeſs, or be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into any publick truſt, place or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of whatever kind under their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties in this Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whither it were that ſome perſons in power thought themſelves too deeply within the reach of the Act, or for what other cauſe is unknown, neither would this Statute be admitted to the touch of the Royal Scepter: So that inſtead of a Living Law it only became a dead peice of Writing. Which was a ſurprize to many that were concern'd in the paſsing it, as well as to ſeveral others, that were zealous for the King and the Kingdoms intereſt, that there ſhould be men found
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64970:92"/>who could ſpy out any thing in this Statute which deſerv'd to be clamoured at, or was worthy to be complained of: more eſpecially ſince every line breathed forth that lenity and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it ſavoured rather of a defect, then any exceſs of Juſtice, and that the utmoſt thereby deſigned was only a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling a few wicked men from ruining the Nation for the future, but nothing of puniſhment for what they had done: for that there were none excepted as to Life, onely the few that were deſigned to be debarred from Offices, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and charactered after ſuch a manner, that the very employing them would diſhonour their Majeſties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the Government.</p>
            <p>Then a draught of an Act was brought in for aboliſhing of Prelacy, and all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of any Office in the Church above Presbytery, and for the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all former Statutes eſtabliſhing Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy and all others contrary to the Act intended. Reſerving to their Majeſties to ſettle the Presbyterian Government in the way moſt agreeable to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples inclinations, and the Word of God.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64970:92"/>Which being Read, the Commiſſioner deſired he might ſee the Act to conſider of it againſt the next day.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 3d. of <hi>July,</hi> the ſame Act was Read again, together with the Act of Parliament, 1662. For the reſtoring of Prelacy; with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Act of the year 1633. and the fourth Act in the year 1681. Which were reſcinded by the Act intended, with ſome amendments in the Narrative part adjuſting and fitting it to that Article in the claim of Right to which it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the following clauſe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the reſcinding part, <hi>In ſo far Allenarly as thoſe reſcinded Acts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the preſent Act, and do eſtabliſh Prelacy, or Superiority of Church Officers above Presbyters.</hi> In the next place the Clauſe in the Act, reſerving to their Majeſties and the Eſtates to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Government of the Church was taken into Conſideration, and it being agreed that the Word <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> ſhould be left out, the Commiſſioner mov'd that in the room of the Words, <hi>To ſettle the Government of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. the alteration might be, <hi>to ſettle ſuch a Government,</hi> &amp;c. upon which a debate
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64970:93"/>aroſe upon the importance of thoſe words, which was put off till the next day.</p>
            <p>Then the Act was again brought in and Read with the amendments, and without the paragraph of the reſcinded Acts. And after ſome debate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Clauſe objected againſt, the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling and Government of the Church being expreſt in the terms following, <hi>That they with the Advice and Conſent of this Parliament will ſettle by Law that Church Governmenu in this Kingdom, which is moſt agreeable to the Peoples In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi> the Act was put to the Vote and Approved. And then the Act ran thus.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas the Eſtates of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their Claim of Right, the Eleventh, of <hi>April</hi> laſt, declared that Prelacy and Supremacy in any Office in the Church, above Presbytery is and has been a great Grievance to this Nation, and contrary to the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, they having reform'd from Popery by Presbyters, and therefore ought to be reſcinded. Our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64970:93"/>Lord and Lady the King and Queens Majeſties do hereby aboliſh Prelacy, and Superiority in any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Church above Presbyters, in this Kingdom; and hereby reſcind, eaſe, and annul the Firſt Act of the Second Seſſion of the Firſt Parliament of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. And the Second Act of the Third Seſſion, of the Second Parliament of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. And the Fourth Act of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. and all other Acts, Statutes and Conſtitutions, in ſo far allenarly, as they are inconſiſtent with this Act, and do eſtabliſh Prelacy, or the Superiority of Church Officers above Presbyters. And the King and Queens Majeſties do declare, That They, with the advice of the Eſtates of this Parliament will ſettle by Law that Church-Government in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is moſt agreeable to the inclinations of the People. This Act was touched with the Scepter the 12th. of <hi>July.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There was alſo another Act which had been made by another Parliament of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. in the year ſixty nine,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64970:94"/>whereby the Parliament did enact aſſert and declare that the ſupream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Supremacy over all perſons, and in all Eccleſiaſtical cauſes within the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by vertue of which the ordering and diſpoſal of the external Government of the Church, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly lodged in the King and His Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors as an inherent Right to the Crown. This was lookt upon to be ſuch a Law that never any Law before gave a greater power to a Prince; and the ill uſe of it in the Execution of King <hi>Charle</hi>'s power by the Biſhops of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by King <hi>James</hi> in claiming by it a power to introduce Popery, made it ſo terrible to the Generality of the Scotch Nation, that after the Eſtates had numbered it among the Chief of their Grievances, the Parliament paſt an Act, immediately after that for abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing Prelacy, whereby they declared, That the firſt Act of the ſecond Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. Intitled <hi>An Act aſſerting His Majeſties Supremacy over all perſons, and in all cauſes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> was inconſiſtent with the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church Government then
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64970:94"/>deſired. Therefore their Majeſties with the Advice and Conſent of the Eſtates in Parliament, did thereby reſcind, abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and annul the foreſaid Act, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſame in all the Heads, Articles and Clauſes thereof to be of no force or effect in all time coming.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this Act paſt without any contradiction, yet was it never touched with the Scepter. Which was the more wondred at, in regard his Majeſties inſtructions were expreſs to his Commiſſioner in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are to paſs an Act eſtabliſhing that Church Government which is moſt agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Inclinations of the people, reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Act of Parliament</hi> 1669. <hi>and all other Acts inconſiſtent therewith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were two great things more in <hi>Agitation</hi> during this Seſſion; the one was the ſettling of the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſince Presbytery was aboliſhed; and the other, about admitting the Lords of the <hi>Seſſion,</hi> and Electing the Preſident of the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt there were two draughts brought into the Houſe, and form'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Acts for the conſideration of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64970:95"/>whole Parliament; the One by the Lord Commiſſioner himſelf; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Lord <hi>Cardroſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt which was preſented by the High Commiſſioner the 22th. of <hi>July,</hi> ran in theſe Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For as much as the King and Queens Majeſties and the Eſtates of Parliament, by their Act of the firſt of</hi> July <hi>Inſtant, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing Prelacy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did declare, That they would ſettle that Church Government which is moſt agreeable to the Inclinations of the People; and conſidering that Church Government by General, Provincial and Presbyterial Aſſemblies, with the Seſſions of the Kirk, as it was eſtabliſhed by the firſt Act of the twelfth Parliament of King</hi> James <hi>the ſixth, holden in</hi> June 1592, <hi>is moſt agreeable to the Inclination of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Therefore the King and Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, with the Advice and Conſent of the Eſtates of Parliament, revive and renew the ſaid Act of Parliament in all the Heads, Poynts and Articles thereof, with this expreſs Declaration</hi> (That the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Occaſional Aſſemblies be firſt repreſented to His Majeſty by humble
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64970:95"/>Supplication) <hi>And Statute and ordain, That it ſhall be lawful for the Presbyters of this Church to admit Miniſters upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation from the lawful Patrons, or</hi> Jure de voluto, <hi>which ſhall happen hereafter, or into Churches which fall not under Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, but were Menſal and Patrimonial Churches belonging to the Biſhops: and ordain all Miniſters in this Kingdom to ſubmit and conform to the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed by the foreſaid Act, and to take the Oath of Allegiance, under the pain of being deprived of their Churches, and loſing their Benefices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it is declared, That all Miniſters that ſhall ſubmit and conform to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Church-Government, and take the Oaths of Allegiance, without being oblig'd to take any other Oath, ſhall enjoy their Churches and Benefices,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and as freely as they ought or might have done before, by the Act in the Year,</hi> 1592. <hi>and to do all and every thing which before pertain'd to Presbyters, and were exerciſed by Biſhops; except for Scandal or Inſufficiency. But in regard there were ſeveral Miniſters deprived of their Benefices ſince the Year</hi> 1662. <hi>for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64970:96"/>not conforming to Prelacy, and others ſince the Year,</hi> 1681. <hi>for not taking the Teſt. Therefore ſeeing that now Prelacy is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and all Acts relating thereto, it is but reaſonable that thoſe Miniſters ſhould be reſtored; Therefore the King and Queens Majesties with the advice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ordain the ſaid Miniſters</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be reſtored. And the King and Queens Majeſties and Eſtates declare, That they will take care to provide thoſe Miniſters now ſerving the Cure at the ſaid Churches, with other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, as occaſion ſhall offer; they ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirming,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And it is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared, that Intrants to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſhall not be obliged to take any other Oaths at their admiſſion then that of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and the Oath</hi> de Fideli.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in regard that many Confuſions and Scandalous Schiſms have happened by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters meddling in Matters of State, Their Majeſties with advice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſcharge all Miniſters of the Goſpel to meddle with any State Affairs, under pain of being held diſ-affected to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be proceeded againſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And declare, That the Jurisdiction of the Church conſiſts onely in Preaching
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64970:96"/>the Word of Jeſus Chriſt, correcting of ill Manners by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the 69th. act of</hi> James 6. Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 6. <hi>And to prevent that nothing be treated in the Church Judicatories that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern affairs of State or Civil matters, it is declared that their Majeſties, if they think fit, may have always one preſent, in all the Provincial and Presbyterial Aſſemblies (as they have their Commiſſioner preſent in General Aſſemblies) to inhibit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in any ſuch affairs, if it ſhould be offered at, until their Majesties and Privy Council be first acquainted therewith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for that there are many things to he ſettled in relation to the Diſcipline of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>their Majesties declare that they with the advice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>will enact ſuch Rules as ſhall tend most to the curbing Vice and advancement of true Piety and Religion, and the preſervation of Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their Majesties alſo, with the advice</hi> &amp;c. <hi>reſcind and annul the</hi> 1. Act <hi>of the</hi> 15. Parl. <hi>of King</hi> James <hi>the</hi> 6. <hi>for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates voting in</hi> Parliament, <hi>and the</hi> 2. Act <hi>of the</hi> 18.

Acts <hi>of the</hi> 22. Parl. <hi>of K.</hi> J. 6. Anno 1617. <hi>concerning the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Restitution of Chapters; and the</hi> 1. Act <hi>of the</hi> 23. Parl. <hi>of K.</hi> J. 6. An. 1621. <hi>about the Ratification of the Articles of the aſſembly of</hi> Perth. <hi>And all Acts and Constitutions whatever prejudicial to the Church-Government by General, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial and Presbyterial Aſſemblies and Kirk-Seſſions; or ſo far as they are in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors or other Prelates whatever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or in favor of the civil places and power of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, their ruling and voting in Parliament</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by vertue of their Titles or any other pretence whatever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And all other Acts inconſistent with this preſent Act.</hi> Concluding with an appointment of the Time and Places for the firſt meeting of the Presbyterial Aſſemblies; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring them to chooſe their Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64970:97"/>with orders to give him the Oath of Allegiance, and to return the Oath taken and ſubſcrib'd, to the Clerks of the Privy Council.</p>
            <p>The Act preſented by the Lord <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſs,</hi> was the ſame for the ſettling the Church Government by General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Presbyters and Provincial Synods: but made no mention of reſcinding the many Acts mention'd in the Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners draught. It was the ſame for reſtoring the deprived Miniſters; but differed in the addition of <hi>Clauſes</hi> for ſentencing and depriving all that gave not Obedience to the Act againſt the owning the late King. It alſo made void all Patronages and Preſentations to Churches, an Intolerable ſervitude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church of God with all Laws made in favour of them, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the 9th. Act of the 1. Parl. of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. Nevertheleſs that the Tithes of the ſaid Churches, whereof the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages were aboliſhed, ſhould belong to the Patrons, and be inſerted in their Infeoffments, in lieu of the ſaid Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, with the burden always of the Miniſters Right and Stipend. There
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64970:98"/>was alſo another Clauſe for ſuſpending all Miniſters called <hi>Conform</hi> Miniſters who entered by and ſtill continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Prelacy from the Exerciſe of any part of the Presbyterian Government; only that they might continue to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Paſtoral Charge within their reſpective Pariſhes, and hold their Kirk-Seſſions for Diſcipline therein, till far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order: Declaring in the laſt place that their Majeſties and the Eſtates would with all conveniency take the advice of ſuch Miniſters as were known to be of the Presbyterian Perſwaſion, and by their advice lay down ſuch methods as ſhould be judged moſt effectual for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Church of all Scandalous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, inſufficient and diſaffected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and providing for the particular Churches with able and well qualified Miniſters, and eſtabliſhing the Exerciſe of the Presbyterian Government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true intent of the Act.</p>
            <p>While the ſettling the Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was thus in debate an Addreſs preſented from the Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Profeſſors to the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64970:98"/>was by him given into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Houſe, and there read upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein, after they had made all due acknowledgements to God, and his Majeſty for their wonderful, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected deliverance from the Great Oppreſſions which they had ſuffer'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cruelty and Ambition of the Prelacy of that Kingdom; they humbly beſeech the Commiſſioner, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of Parliament, ſeeing the King had declared, and their Lordſhips with him had zealouſly appeared for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, That they would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed by their Civil Sanction to eſtabliſh and ratifie the late Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, with the larger and ſhorter Catechiſms, which contained the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Doctrine of the reformed Churches; the directory of Worſhip, and Presbyterial Church Government, all agreeable to the Word of God, and formerly received by the General Conſent of the Nation. And in regard that Prelacy and all who had entered under Prelacy, had been impoſed upon the Church without her Conſent, in any
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64970:99"/>of her free General Aſſemblies, and that Presbyterian Government could not be ſafe in the hands of thoſe who were of contrary Principles; therefore they humbly petitioned, that the Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment might be eſtabliſhed in the hands of ſuch only, who by their former carriage and ſufferings were known to be ſound Presbyterians, and well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to His Majeſties Government, and that thoſe Miniſters yet alive who were thruſt from their Churches might be reſtored.</p>
            <p>They alſo pray that they might be allowed by Civil Sanction to appoint Viſitations for the purging out of inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and ſcandalous Miniſters; and that Patronages which had their Riſe from the moſt corrupt and latter times of Chriſtianiſm might be aboliſhed, and the Church eſtabliſh'd upon its former good foundations confirmed by many acts of Parliament, 1560.</p>
            <p>And that all Acts ratifying Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and impoſing Puniſhments upon Presbyterians for Non-conformity, might be aboliſh'd; and laſtly that their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips would take care that learned ſound
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64970:99"/>and Godly men might be put into the Univerſities and Seminaries of Learning; humbly ſubmitting to their Lordſhips wiſdom the method of conſidering and effectuating theſe their deſires.</p>
            <p>But neither did either of the two draughts pleaſe, neither could the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration of the Addreſs be at that time entered upon. For the Houſe had made an order the day before, by reaſon of a Letter from the King to the Privy Council, and a Proclamation thereupon by them iſſued forth for opening the Signet, not to proceed any farther in the affair of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the Letter and Proclamation were conſidered, that in the mean time there ſhould be a ſtopt put to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Signet. Only they were ſo farr willing to gratifie the Addreſſers, that they Voted and approved an Act for reſtoring Presbyterian Miniſters to their Churches, which was preſented by Sir <hi>William Hamilton,</hi> To this effect;</p>
            <p>That whereas in purſuance of the Claim of Right, Prelacy, &amp;c. was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and that many Miniſters of the Presbyterian perſwaſion ſince the firſt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64970:100"/>of <hi>January</hi> 1661. had been deprived of their Churches, or baniſhed for not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming. Therefore their Majeſties with advice of the Eſtates ordained, that thoſe Miniſters, ſhould forthwith have free acceſs to their Churches and exerciſe the Miniſtry in thoſe Pariſhes without any new call thereto; and enjoy the benefits and ſtipends thereto belonging, with ſom reſerve to the incumbent of the laſt years rent as if the Churches were not vacant.</p>
            <p>But then the buſineſs of the Lords of the Seſſions coming on, the Queſtion was put, <hi>Whither the Nomination of the Lords of the Seſſions made by His Majeſty, in caſe of a Total vacancy required the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament? And whither it were requiſite by the conſitution of the Colledge of Juſtice, that the Preſident of the Seſſion ſhould be Elected by the Lords of the Seſſion?</hi> Theſe two Points occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a long debate, at the end of which the draught of an Act was brought in declaring the methods of naming and admitting the Lords of the Seſſion; To this effect,</p>
            <p>That by the Laws of the Kingdom, when the place of an Ordinary Lord of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64970:100"/>a Seſſion was vacant, it was to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the Kings nomination of a fit perſon for the ſaid Office, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the reſt of the Lords of the Seſſion, to be tryed or rejected by them, but that then there was a total vacancy, by reaſon of the happy Revolution, ſo that there could be no ſuch Tryal by the Lords: in which caſe when ſuch to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal vacancies fell out, the Lords were either nominated by the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament joyntly; or if they were nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the King, and the Lords ſo nominated were admitted by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore the Act was ſo drawn that their Majeſties would nominate fit perſons for the ſaid Office and preſent them to the Parliament, to be tryed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or rejected by them.</p>
            <p>It was alſo farther ordained, That at all times hereafter when any ſuch total Vacancy ſhould happen, that the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Lords of the Seſſion ſhould be in the King and Queen for the time being, or in the Regent, during a Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo they ſhould be preſented to the Parliament to be tryed, &amp;c. It was alſo farther Enacted that there ſhould
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64970:101"/>be a Ratification by their Majeſties of the 93. Act of the 6th. Parliament of K. <hi>J.</hi> the VI. concerning the Admiſſion of the Ordinary Lords of Seſſion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of abuſes therein. And the 132 Act of the 12th. Parliament of King <hi>James</hi> the VI. concerning the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Preſentation, Qualities and age of the Lords of the Seſſion; in all the heads, clauſes and articles of it: as alſo of the clauſe contained in the 93 Act of the 6th. Parliament of King <hi>James</hi> the VI. Declaring that the Preſident of the Colledge of Juſtice ſhould be Elected by the whole Senate.</p>
            <p>This Act as it was drawn into form, was read again the next day, together with the 93 Act of the 6th. Parliament, and the 132 Act of the 12th. Parliament of King <hi>James</hi> the VI. to which the draught referred. And upon debate for a long time, the Queſtion being put, <hi>Whither the Vote of the Houſe in reference to the Act ſhould be ſtated in the terms, of</hi> approve or not approve, <hi>Or of</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to His Majeſties, or not? It was carryed that the Vote ſhould be put, <hi>approve or not approve;</hi> and then the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64970:101"/>queſtion being put, Whither the <hi>Act was Approved or not?</hi> It was carried in the affirmative.</p>
            <p>The Parliament having proceeded thus farr, thought fit in purſuance of their Vote and Approbation of their Act, to make another Vote, that the ſtop put to the Signet ſhould be continued, and that an Order ſhould be drawn up for that purpoſe, till the High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner ſhould repreſent the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to His Majeſty, and that he ſhould be pleaſed to declare his farther pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But in the Height of this diſpute the Parliament was adjourned upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the eight of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> next enſuing; and when that day approached from the eighth of <hi>October</hi> to the twentieth of <hi>December</hi> following, and from thence again to the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> which cauſed a long Ceſſation of Parliamentary buſineſs. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore thus brought the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the end of their City Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it may be time to look into the Field, the rather becauſe it was but a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while before the adjournment of the Parliament, that the rebellion of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> came to any thing like a Period.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:64970:102"/>
            <p>The main diſturbance after the happy Revolution, was raiſed by the Viſcount of <hi>Dundee,</hi> who as he began with ſmall beginnings, ſo through the vigilance of the Convention, and the Parliament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, he never arrived at any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to render him very formidable; only by lurking and roaming up and down in the Faſtneſſes of the Highlands, he took his opportunities more like a Freebooter, then an Enemy to commit petty miſchiefs, that at length brought inglorious ruine upon himſelf, and thoſe that adher'd to him.</p>
            <p>At firſt he was ſaid to be gone North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and that a <hi>Herald</hi> was ſent after him to ſummon him before the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he could not be met with. So that becauſe he refuſed to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Convention, and for that he kept an Armed Force about his own Houſe, and correſponded with the D. of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> he was upon the 30th. of <hi>March</hi> denounced a Rebel by the Vote of the whole Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Upon the Herald and the Trumpeters being ſent after him, he ſent a letter to the Preſident of the Convention, to excuſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64970:102"/>his abſence and his not appearing; ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wonder at it as an extraordinary thing, that a Trumpeter and a Herald ſhould be ſent to ſummon a Man to lay down Arms, that was living peaceably at his own Houſe. That he did not think his perſon ſafe among ſo many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies as he had in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and who as he was well aſſured, had laid their deſigns to murder him, and therefore he hop'd the Convention would diſcharge ſuch a groundleſs purſuit. That if they thought his appearance neceſſary, yet it was impoſſible for him to attend with freedom and ſafety in regard of the Men of War, and Foreign Troops that lay in his way. Concluding that if the Convention could not be prevailed with to wave his appearance, yet that they would delay it till his Lady was brought to bed, and offering in the mean while, either to give his Parol or Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity not to diſturb the peace.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this Letter, the next news that the <hi>Convention</hi> heard of him was, that he was gone Northward with a part of Fourſcore Horſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his March toward the Duke of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64970:103"/>
               <hi>Gourdons</hi> Countrey, where he was in hopes to find more aſſiſtance, which cauſed the Convention to give Orders for a conſiderable Force to make after him. His firſt act of Hoſtility was done againſt the Town of <hi>Innerneſs,</hi> to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of which place he ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand contribution, threatning them with Military execution unleſs they paid it. But the neighbouring Gentry gathering together a conſiderable Force got into the Town, and conſtrained him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf again to the Hills. After this he attempted to have ſurprized the Town of <hi>Dundee,</hi> but he found them ſo well prepared to receive him, that he was forced to draw off. After which two unſucceſsful attempts in a very dark night he entred St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taking the two Lairds of <hi>Blaire</hi> and <hi>Pollock,</hi> two Gentlemen of Quality out of their Beds, haſtened back to his Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>Several other attempts he made, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving encreaſed his ſtrength by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Mackdonalds, Mackleans</hi> and others that came into his party, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came above three thouſand ſtrong, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64970:103"/>threatned to fall into the County of <hi>Argyle.</hi> Of all which things the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention had daily Intelligence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered Major General <hi>Mackay</hi> with a conſiderable Force to hunt the Rebel out of all his Lurking holes. The Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> was alſo ſent to ſecure the Country of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Ramſey</hi> and others to ſhut up other Paſſes into the Highlands to prevent the daily Incurſions of the Rebels, who lived onely upon the ſpoil of their Neighbors. Nor was the Major General leſs Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant to follow the Rebels, watching all opportunities to get at them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge them out of their Faſtneſſes either by Surprize or open Force. But as it was found out afterwards <hi>Dundee</hi> had ſtill Intelligence out of the Kings Army of all the Motions and Deſigns of the Major General; by which means <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> being continually forewarn'd, fled from one Hill to another, and from one Wood to another to the great vexation and diſappointment of the purſuers.</p>
            <p>But this Conſpiracy was about the middle of <hi>June</hi> luckily diſcloſed by the ſurprize of a Footman, who carried ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64970:104"/>Letters which diſcover'd the whole Conſpiracy, and all the Conſpirators were ſoon after apprehended; who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be all Officers and Souldiers of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Regiment of Dragoons; among whom the moſt conſiderable were Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Levingſton,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lieutenant <hi>Creictown,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Murray,</hi> and ſeveral others; of which there were ſome confeſt that the bottom of the deſign was to have betrayed the Army to <hi>Dundee,</hi> and to have ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Major General in his Tent; or at leaſt to have gone over to <hi>Dundee</hi> upon the firſt engagement that ſhould have happened between Him and the Rebels. For which being Tryed by a Council of War, they all threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Kings Mercy.</p>
            <p>Much about the ſame time four or five hundred <hi>Iriſh</hi> commanded by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Cannon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Vanchap,</hi> Colonel <hi>Buchon</hi> and others, Landed in the Iſle of <hi>Mull</hi> to joyn <hi>Dundee.</hi> This re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement was ſent by the late King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Convoy of three <hi>French</hi> Men of War, two of Thirty five Guns apiece, and one of twenty three, and were met
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64970:104"/>by two <hi>Scotch</hi> Frigats, commanded by Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> and Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> who fought the Three <hi>French</hi> Men till they had neither powder nor Shot left, and that the two Captains and moſt of their Men were killed or diſabled; ſo that they both fell into the Enemies hands; though Captain <hi>Browns</hi> Ship was ſoon after re-taken by Captain <hi>Rook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this ſupply, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Mackay,</hi> being reſolved to go and find out the Enemy, directed his March as far as <hi>Lochaber,</hi> through the County of <hi>Athol;</hi> as well in hopes to joyn a body of Fifteen Hundred <hi>Athol</hi> Men, which as he was made believe would appear for him, ſo ſoon as he came into that Country; as alſo to take in the Caſtle of <hi>Blair,</hi> where one <hi>Stuart</hi> of <hi>Belloghen</hi> had planted ſome <hi>Athol</hi> Men for <hi>Dundee.</hi> To this purpoſe upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday the 17th. of <hi>July,</hi> he marched about ſixteen Miles, and got through a narrow paſs, where three or four men could hardly go abreaſt. But by that time Intelligence was brought him, that <hi>Dundee</hi> was near at hand, and ready to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64970:105"/>engage him about two Miles from <hi>Blair</hi> Caſtle. Upon which he drew up his Men in <hi>Battalia,</hi> to the number of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three and four thouſand foot, two Troops of Horſe, and two of Dragoons. On the other ſide, <hi>Dundee</hi> came on with about ſix Thouſand Foot, and a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe. The fight began between four and five in the Afternoon, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till very near Night. Both ſides fought with great Courage and Reſolution for ſome time, till ſome of the Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Regiments being overpowred by the Enemy, and giving way, put ſome part of his forces into Diſorder, ſo that he was forced to draw off and retire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Sterling,</hi> where he arrived on Monday Night with a Body of Fifteen Hundred Men in very good Order. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men were ſlain on both ſides, but more of the Enemy; and that which moſt of all augmented their Loſs, was the Death of the Lord of <hi>Dundee,</hi> who was ſlain with a ſhot which he received in his left Eye.</p>
            <p>Many people believed that there was Treachery in this Buſineſs, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the <hi>Athol</hi> Men, of whom not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64970:105"/>above ſixty came to the Major General, of fifteen Hundred which he expected; and of thoſe few that came to his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſome that were ſent to bring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the Enemies Motions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of doing their Duty, went and gave the Rebels Advice of all the Major General's Demarches.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, in ſome meaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate this Misfortune, ſoon after the Major General having received Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that a ſelected Party of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to the number of five or ſix hundred Horſe, Foot and Dragoons had a deſign to fall upon St. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s, to ſurprize the Stores and Proviſions that lay there for the ſupply of His Majeſties Forces, marched out from <hi>Sterling</hi> with a Party of Horſe and Dragoons, and happening to meet with the Rebels, gave them a total Rout; kill'd and took the greateſt number of them, and among the reſt, Captain <hi>Hacket,</hi> who commanded the Party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dundee</hi> being dead, the Earl of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferlin,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Cannon</hi> contended for the chief Command, and ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the late King to determine
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64970:106"/>the Conteſt; by whom it was decided for Colonel <hi>Cannon.</hi> Not ſo well done, as ſome thought to prefer a ſtranger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Native ſo conſiderable for his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: eſpecially conſidering how natural it is for the <hi>Scots</hi> to adhere to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of their own Country.</p>
            <p>However <hi>Cannon</hi> hoping to ſupply that defect by gaining Reputation to his Honour, reſolved to ſignalize himſelf by ſome great Exploit. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe underſtanding that Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Cleeland</hi> lay at <hi>Donkel</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi>'s Regiment, conſiſting of Eight Hundred Men, came down from the Hills upon him with all his force that made up the Number of between three and four Thouſand Men, beſides the Addition of the Country. <hi>Cleeland</hi> obſerving the great Diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Number of his own Party and the Rebels, took his Ground the moſt advantagiouſly that the place would give leave, planting his men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Dikes and Ditches which he cauſed to be caſt up, as alſo within the Walls of the Marqueſs of <hi>Athol</hi>'s Houſe and Garden, and in the Church and Steeple
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64970:106"/>of the Town. The <hi>Highlanders</hi> came on in ſwarms, firing onely once and then running in with their Swords and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets; but <hi>Cleelands</hi> men received them ſo warmly, and plyed them ſo faſt with their ſmall Shot, as they preſt on in Throngs and Crowds, that few of the Defendants Bullets flew in vain. In the heat of this Action <hi>Cleeland</hi> himſelf was wounded in the head and dy'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. The Major of the Regiment was deſparately wounded: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Souldiers were ſo far from being diſmayed at the fall of their two chiefeſt Officers, that they fought with ſo much the greater Courage, and behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with that effectual Reſolution, that after a hot diſpute of three Hours, the Rebels found themſelves conſtrain'd to fly back to their Hills, leaving a great number of Carcaſes behind them; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that when ſome of the Officers of the Rebels would have had them retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and given the Victors the other Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, they would not hear of it, crying out, they would not fight againſt Men both Deſperate and Mad. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report was, that about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64970:107"/>of the Rebels were ſlain, and not above thirty of <hi>Cleelands</hi> men in all; and the next day ſome parties that were ſent to the Aſſiſtance of thoſe who had fought ſo bravely, going out to ſcowre the Country, found ſeveral dead bodies of the Rebels ſtrew'd about the Country, which made it believ'd that the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Rebels was much greater than it was ſaid to be.</p>
            <p>This defeat of the whole Body of the Rebels created a great diſlike of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Cannons</hi> conduct among the <hi>Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and ſo diſcouraged the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that this defeat being given toward the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> by the tenth of <hi>September</hi> the Lords of the Council had work enough to receive the Submiſſions of the Highland <hi>Lairds,</hi> and Heads of <hi>Clanns,</hi> who came in and took the Benefit of the Act of Indempnity: as did alſo the Earl of <hi>Callendar,</hi> Lord <hi>Duffus,</hi> and Lord <hi>Levingſton,</hi> who took the Oath of Allegiance and gave ſecurity for their peaceable Behaviour. And as for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Cannon</hi> himſelf he loſt his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the <hi>Highlanders</hi> to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that after he had long lain lurking
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64970:107"/>about <hi>Innerlochy,</hi> to no purpoſe, they told him to his Face they would not any longer obey his Orders, as being a man that neither underſtood their Language, nor had any Intereſt or Fortune in their Country; and in a few Nights after rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him of all he had; breaking open his Trunks, and taking away his Cloaths and his Money, not ſparing his purſe of Gold, wherein he had fourſcore <hi>Louis d'Or,</hi> and two and twenty <hi>Guinies.</hi> So that, after ſuch bad Uſage, he thought it his beſt way to retreat into <hi>Ireland</hi> with all the Secrecy he could, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his Life ſecure among ſuch a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and Thieving Generation of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but for all that he did not go.</p>
            <p>All this while the common Courſe of Juſtice in the uſual Trials at Law had been at a ſtand, partly through the combuſtions occaſioned by the Viſcount of <hi>Dundee,</hi> partly through the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſiſting upon their priviledge of approving the perſons nominated for Lords of the Seſſions by the King, and the Right of chooſing the Preſident, which they alleadged was to be done by the Members of the ſame Court. But
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64970:108"/>the Troubles of the Rebellion being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Parliament before their Adjournment having ſent to know the Kings Pleaſure in ſo weighty a Concern, his Majeſty ſent a Letter bearing date the Firſt of <hi>October,</hi> to his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, by whom all matters of State were now tranſacted, ſignifying,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That whereas the Eſtates of Parliament had thought fit to ſtop the opening of the Signet for ſome time, till he ſhould ſignifie his pleaſure concerning the Nomination of the Lords of the Seſſion, therefore upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of the Matter, and the great Inconveniencies that would ariſe to his Subject by ſo long a ſurceaſe of Juſtice, he had reſolved to make up a compleat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Lords of the Seſſion, and to have the Signet opened that Juſtice might have it's Courſe. To which purpoſe he required and authoriſed his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to iſſue forth a Proclamation to certifie the People, that the Seſſions would ſit at the Ordinary time, being the firſt of</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember <hi>enſuing; declaring withal that the Seſſions ſhould then ſit and proceed in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64970:108"/>of Proceſſes renewed in His and the Queens name, and that the Signet ſhould be open at the ſame time for the expediting of all Summons and Writs in common Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the ſame Letter the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were ordered to give notice to the Lords that had been formerly nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whoſe Oaths had been taken by the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> by His Majeſties ſpecial Order to give their Attendance for the paſſing Bills of Suſpenſion and all other Bills according to the common Form.</p>
            <p>And whereas Sir <hi>James Dalrimple</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the Colledge of Juſtice, and Sir <hi>John Baird,</hi> whom the King had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his place, and Mr. <hi>Alexander Scomtown</hi> of <hi>Marſington,</hi> had been tryed as to their Qualifications required by the Acts of Parliament, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly admitted, the Privy Council was therefore commanded to appoint them or any two of them to examine the Qualifications of the other perſons no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by His Majeſty, and to admit
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64970:109"/>them if they found them qualified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of this Letter a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was iſſued forth, and the Lord <hi>Newbaith</hi> being called in before the Privy Council took the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance as one of the Lords of the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at the ſame time both he, the Lords <hi>Armſtown, Croſsrig</hi> and <hi>Merſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> were ordered to attend the paſſing the Bills of ſuſpenſion, and the Lords <hi>Newbaith</hi> and <hi>Merſington</hi> appointed to examine the reſt of the Lords which had been nominated by the King.

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Lowthian</hi> was made Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice General, or Supreme Judge of the Criminal Court.</p>
            <p>The Laird of <hi>Ceſnoch,</hi> Lord Juſtice <hi>Clark,</hi> or Aſſiſtant to the Juſtice Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and</p>
            <pb n="206" facs="tcp:64970:110"/>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Dalrimple</hi> was made Lord Advocate.</p>
            <p>The Lords <hi>Aberuchel, Rankillor, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Hall, Pheſdo</hi> and <hi>Croſsrigg,</hi> were made Commiſſioners of the Kings Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary.</p>
            <p>Which Court being opened the firſt time ſince the Revolution upon the Twenty ſeventh of <hi>January,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lowthian</hi> expreſs'd himſelf in a Learned Speech, to this effect.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place by way of Excuſe, He acknowledged, That when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Hight Station wherein His Majeſty had placed him, the greatneſs and weight of the Affair, and his own want of Experience and many other unfitneſſes, nothing ſo much aſſur'd him as to ſee ſuch perſons, ſo eminent for their Abilities, their Integrity and skill in the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, to be Aſſeſſors with him in the ſame Court.</p>
            <p>That nothing could be of more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence toward the Eſtabliſhment of the Crown, the Peace and flouriſhing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64970:110"/>of the Nation, and calming the Minds of the People, than the Aſſurance of Impartial Juſtice, which he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded would by the choice of their Lordſhips have the deſir'd Effects.</p>
            <p>He deſir'd not to make reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paſt Miſcarriages, otherwiſe then as to be a Beacon to keep men from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shipwrack upon the ſame Rocks.</p>
            <p>That the Corruptions of Mankind did often compel Juſtice it ſelf to incline more to ſeverity then were to be wiſh'd, yet that it ought to be diſpenſed with ſuch Moderation, that the Sentence it ſelf might convince the world, that there was not wanting in it both Mercy and Favour.</p>
            <p>That it was not the Goodneſs or Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Climate, nor the Goodneſs of the Laws that made a Kingdom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but their paſſing through thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Channels whoſe Ambition, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Pride rendered them fit Tools for Tyrannical Arbitrary Men, that was to be prevented. So that if their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips did but make it their Duty, Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Intereſt to imitate their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Prudent, Valiant and juſt Prince
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64970:111"/>and Deliverer, the Nation would be the moſt happy in the World.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch that for his part, if he could be ſo Fortunate as to add but one Grain to the Scale of Equity, he ſhould eſteem it his greateſt Advantage, and himſelf overpaid for all the pains he could ever he capable of.</p>
            <p>This Speech of the Earl of <hi>Lothian,</hi> as it was received with a deſerved applauſe by the other Lords and Officers, ſo the Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> in General quickly perceived the difference between the Arbitrary proceedings of the late Reign, and the legal and eaſie adminiſtration of Juſtice ſince the happy Revolution, and the late ſettlement of the juſticiary here; a particular inſtance of this may be ſeen in the permitting the Lady <hi>Caſtle-Haven</hi> to enter a Proteſtation againſt a Decree even of the Lords of the Seſſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in a caſe before their Lordſhips, betwixt the ſaid Counteſs and the Lord <hi>Collington</hi> her ſon in Law, wherein ſhe declared her reſolution to ſeek her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in the next enſuing Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; a Liberty which for many
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64970:111"/>years before has been diſallowed and found impracticable by the Scottiſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding the many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantages accruing to this Kingdom by the redreſs of thoſe Grievances, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they had for ſeveral years lay, there were found ſeveral ill affected perſons who both by publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate practices, endeavoured to diſturb and bring into confuſion the preſent well ſettled Government.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>February</hi> eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine, five Gentlemen of the Shire of <hi>Angus</hi> were apprehended and brought away priſoners for committing a Riot, that by the circumſtances produc'd and prov'd againſt them, of an Inſolence not often parallel'd. It ſeems they being at a Countrey Wedding, they amongſt other Healths, began and drank that of the late King, not at the ſame time omitting ſome ſcandalous Reflections on the preſent management of Affairs; and not content with their own crimes were reſolved to force others of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to a commiſſion of the ſame, and accordingly drawing their Swords ſet
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64970:112"/>them the to refuſers breaſts, threatning immediate death without their compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; their names were <hi>Durham</hi> of <hi>Omaghie, Graham</hi> of <hi>Duntreath,</hi> with his two brothers, and <hi>Guthrick</hi> of that Title; but being carried before the Privy Council, after a full hearing, the two firſt were ſentenced and adjudged, the one to pay one hundred pounds, the other five hundred Marks, and to be impriſoned till the payment thereof: And now his Majeſty having in a Letter bearing date the thirteenth of <hi>February,</hi> intimated his kind acceptance of the Lords of his Privy Councils humble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, that His Majeſty would be pleaſed to be preſent at the next Seſſion of Parliament, which was to be holden the firſt of <hi>March</hi> next enſuing; he gives them many reiterated aſſurances of his Gracious deſigns and reſolutions to perfect the delivery of the Proteſtant Religion in general, from the many dangers and encroachments it lay under, and in particular of the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but that upon mature conſideration that the many ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and great matters that concerned
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64970:112"/>the common good of the Proteſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt throughout his Kingdoms and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, did indiſpenſably require him to meet his people of <hi>England</hi> in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be held on the twentieth day of <hi>March,</hi> he thought fit to continue the adjournment of the Parliament of that his ancient Kingdom to ſome longer time, and therefore required them to iſſue out in his Majeſties name a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for the adjournment of the ſaid Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the firſt to the eighteenth of <hi>March</hi> enſuing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt and which time he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to lay down ſuch meaſures, and give ſuch inſtructions to his High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner till his Affairs would permit his own preſence, as he doubted not would give ſatisfaction to his people; graciouſly expreſſing to them that he ſhould always prefer their ſafety to his own quiet and repoſe. Aſſuring them that he eſteemed the governing by Law, to be the greateſt and fureſt of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives.</p>
            <p>Upon the receipt of His Majeſties Gracious Letter, the Privy Council forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with iſſu'd their Proclamation in His
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64970:113"/>Majeſties name to adjourn the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the firſt to the eighteenth of <hi>March</hi> following.</p>
            <p>About this time one <hi>Strachan</hi> who was ſuſpected to have held and carryed on a correſpondence with the late King <hi>James,</hi> was apprehended at <hi>Greenock</hi> by a party of the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Regiment, and brought Priſoner to <hi>Endinburgh;</hi> he was examined before a Committee of the Privy Council, to whom after a promiſe of his Life made to him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed all that he knew of the matter: he owned he was a Roman Catholick, and that he had lately come from <hi>Dublin</hi> with ſeveral Letters, Commiſſions and Papers from the late King, which with other things he had delivered to one <hi>Gourdon</hi> a Regent of Philoſophy, in the Colledge of <hi>Glaſgow. Gourdon</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by the application of the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> was forthwith ſiezed and brought up to Town, and upon ſearch there were ſeveral Treaſonable Papers and Commiſſions found about him, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance to conceal them was by ſowing them up in the ſoles of his ſhoes, the directions were to ſeveral ſuſpected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64970:113"/>and an order to apprehend them was immediately iſſued forth. Theſe Papers were thought to make an ample diſcovery of the late Kings deſigns on the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of moſt of the perſons that were to be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the bringing them about, nor were the publick and hoſtile endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Rebels leſs unfortunate or ſucceſsful, than the private intrigues and managements of ſome disaffected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this Kingdom. For Sir <hi>Thomas Levingſton</hi> about the latter end of this Moneth being advertiſed that ſeveral Partys of the Rebels deſigned to Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouze about the Caſtle of <hi>Erchleſs,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Chiſholm</hi> of <hi>Strathglaſs,</hi> he preſently orders a detachment of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Companies of Foot, of the Lord <hi>Strathnavers</hi> Regiment, two of the Laird of <hi>Grants</hi> Regiment, two Companies out of the Garriſons of <hi>Caſtlehead</hi> and <hi>Braan,</hi> with two Troops of Horſe, all under the command of Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Lumsdane</hi> to advance to <hi>Strathglaſs</hi> and <hi>Erchleſs,</hi> with inſtructions to uſe Military Execution on all that oppoſed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64970:114"/>them, and becauſe the Caſtle of <hi>Erchleſs</hi> ſeem'd to ſtand convenient for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling a Garriſon which might overawe and reſtrain the incurſions and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> they were order'd to leave a ſufficient number for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to make good the place: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt approach of our Forces the Rebels became ſhame-fac'd, and turn'd their backs flying with all the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy imaginable to the Hills, and their other Faſtneſſes leaving us a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble booty of all ſorts of Proviſion, and Forrage for Man and Horſe, together with ſome hundreds of Bolls of Oats, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the uſe of the Earl of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferling.</hi> At our departure from hence there were left four Companies of Foot under the command of Major <hi>Mackay;</hi> and now the time for the Sitting of the Parliament drawing on, we had ſeveral flying diſcourſes that the Honourable the Lord <hi>Mellvill</hi> Secretary of State, was preparing hither from <hi>England</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no leſs a Character 'tis thought than Lord High Commiſſioner for the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seſſions of Parliament; though for ſometimes ſeem'd to hang in diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64970:114"/>his Grace Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and his Lordſhip yet the ſpeedy Arrival of his Lordſhip, put it out of all doubt, and upon the opening of his Commiſſion he was forthwith Declared High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner for the enſuing Seſſion, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly made his entrance into the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> with a Magnificence ſuitable to that Character, being attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Nobility and Gentry, and the Kings Guards to his lodging; after which Ceremonies the Council ſat, where his Lordſhip intimated His Majeſties pleaſure to them to iſſue out a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for the farther adjournment of the Parliament, from the eighteenth to the twenty ſeventh of <hi>March</hi> inſtant, which was by proclamation adjourn'd accordingly. About this time there were four promoted to the dignity of Earls of this Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord <hi>Mellvin</hi> created Earl of <hi>Rith,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>Dowgiaſs,</hi> was created Earl of <hi>Dundee:</hi> Sir <hi>James Dalrimple</hi> of <hi>Stair</hi> Lord Preſident of the Seſſions was made Earl of <hi>Hare,</hi> and Major General <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kay</hi> was made Earl of—</p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:64970:115"/>
            <p>The Lord High Commiſſioner with his Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Council, about this time taking into their ſerious conſideration, how much the good and welfare of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> depended on the unanimous and wiſe Counſels of the enſuing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thought fit about this time to iſſue out their Orders for a day of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a general Faſt, to be held and obſerved in the South parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by all people both in Meeting Houſes and Churches, to ſend up their humble ſupplications and prayers for his bleſſing on the proceedings of the enſuing Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was moſt Religiouſly and devoutly obſerv'd in all places; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed conſidering the ſeveral diſtractions about matters of Religion, in general and particularly about Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that had for many years by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fits broken out and rag'd in that Government, it could not but provoke the moſt zealous prayers and wiſhes of that people, for the proſperous agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good Reſolurions of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on which they look'd as reſolv'd to ſettle matters as they ſhould be found
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64970:115"/>moſt agreeable and ſuitable to the genius and inclination of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Rebels all this time received freſh diſappointments every day, and their Army ſtill dwindled into ſmall inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable parties, ſeveral of their Friends of Note forſook them, and the promiſes of recruits and aſſiſtance of Arms and Ammunition fail'd them. Colonel <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> had gone for <hi>Ireland</hi> a good while agone from them, and though he had promiſed them ſpeedily to return with ſufficient ſupplies, yet they could hear no news of him, ſeveral of the <hi>Highland Clans</hi> refus'd to joyn with them, and amongſt them Sir <hi>Donald mac Donald</hi> of <hi>Sclate,</hi> who was a man of great inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt among them. Several that were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their eſcapes to <hi>Dublin</hi> to the late King were taken, on the Coaſt of the North of <hi>Ireland;</hi> amongſt which were two Sons of the Provoſt of <hi>Bell</hi> of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> one <hi>Forreſter</hi> a Clergy-man, and one <hi>Dunbar</hi> that was Gunner in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> when it was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by the Eſtates, in the Names of their Majeſties King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> all theſe perſons having been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64970:116"/>to the preſent Government laſt year by their Plots and Conſpiracies to diſturb the peace, and raiſe War in the Kingdom, were apprehended and laid in Goal, and being guarded up to Town by the Earl of <hi>Eglinton</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe were brought before the Privy Council, and upon their promiſes of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peacefully hereafter, and making what diſcoveries they could at preſent, they were by their Lordſhips clemency bail'd and ſet at liberty. The Counteſs Dowager of <hi>Arrol</hi> who had been appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and ſent Priſoner to <hi>Dumbarton</hi> Caſtle, upon an accuſation of her holding Treaſonable correſpondence with the late King <hi>James,</hi> and others; their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſties profeſs'd Enemies: was now alſo upon her petition removed to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> Caſtle. The Lord <hi>Belcarras</hi> was bail'd out alſo, who was one that was taken in the North with the Lord <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> and <hi>Auchintrat</hi> all three Roman Catholicks. Thus the Government by all the mild applications and endeavours ſtrove to reduce all parties that ſeem'd disaffected to the happy change that was wrought in this Kingdom, or at leaſt to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64970:116"/>leave them without excuſe or complaint, that may or ſhall afterwards be inflicted on them for their obſtinacy and wicked perſeverance in any of their aforeſaid crimes.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of this month of <hi>March,</hi> and within three or four days of the time appointed by his Majeſty for the Sitting of the Parliament, His Majeſty was pleaſed to ſignifie again by His Letter, His Royal Will and Pleaſure for the farther adjournment of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to the fifteenth day of <hi>April</hi> next enſuing. The Letter was in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to this purpoſe, That the earneſt deſire he had of bringing all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and deliberations of the Parliament to a happy cloſe, and as much to the general ſatisfaction as could be, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with him upon mature conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to defer the time of their meeting for a ſmall time, until ſome few buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before them were ſo prepar'd, and ſome intereſts ſo adjuſted and diſpoſed, as that the unity of their Counſels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after might be an encouragement to all good men, and an utter diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe who were Enemies, as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64970:117"/>well to them as himſelf; and who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured nothing more than to ſatisfie their vain hopes by ſome ſeeming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of breeding Diviſions amongſt them. That ſince the urgency of his other Affairs had deprived him of the ſatisfaction of being himſelf amongſt them for the preſent, he had till a more favourable opportunity ſhould preſent, recommended to them the E. of <hi>Mell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> from whoſe good qualifications he doubted not of thoſe methods that might remove the cauſes of their evils with their effects, and from whoſe Wiſdom he hoped they would find matters ſo prepar'd for their conſideration, as ſhould bring his Subjects to that Concord and Unity in his Service, as ſhould make that Meeting be called the Happy and Healing Parliament. Upon this Letter of his Majeſty, the Privy Council imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately iſſu'd their Proclamation for the adjournment of the Parliament to the time aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>In the mean time our Army proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Rebels with vigour and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſucceſs; and Colonel <hi>Hill</hi> was by His Majeſties Commiſſion Conſtituted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64970:117"/>Governour of <hi>Innerlochy</hi> in <hi>Lochaber,</hi> and until ſuch time that <hi>Lochaber</hi> were reduced, and ſome Fortifications rais'd for the ſecurity of the Garriſon in <hi>Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochy,</hi> he had the Government of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffage</hi> conferr'd on him; he is extreamly well affected to their preſent Majeſties, and very exquiſitely acquainted with all the methods and ways of the <hi>Highland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> as well as the places, and it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that in a little time he ſhould be able to give as good account of them, as when he was Governour there before; and had there a Garriſon of about eight hundred men, having by his knowledg and induſtry reduc'd it to a regular compliance with the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>His Grace Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> was about this time made Lord Preſident of His Majeſties Council, and firſt Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner of the Great Seal, the Council ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the majority of Votes put an end to ſome former diſputes about ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Warrants of Council, it being Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now that the ſubſcription of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident alone ſhould in all Orders and Warrants ſerve as fully as if they had
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64970:118"/>all Signed it. The Counteſs of <hi>Arrol</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the proffer of the Council, Liberty upon her Parol of Honour to be any where within ten Miles of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> would not agree to it which gave a juſt occaſion to have a guard ſet upon her. 'Tis the nature of ſome people to be peeviſh and ſtubborn even when they are beſt us'd, they are uneaſie in their natures and diſcontented for trifles, and love to be claſhing with Authority, we have ſeen very lately the leaſt diſlike even of the known irregularities of the Government ſufficient to give one an apprehenſion of being indicted for High Treaſon, and as the ſinfulneſs of one Reign will not, nor ought to be made uſe of as a Preſident for another to tread the ſame ſteps, ſo I muſt be bold to ſay, that the abuſe of Mercy in this, ought to be as ſeverely proſecuted againſt ſome ſorts of people, as the abuſe of Juſtice in the other. The <hi>Highlanders</hi> upon the approach of the Summer ſeaſon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their uſual Cuſtoms, were now preparing to make incurſions upon the borders, and forming themſelves into a body of four or five hundred, made a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64970:118"/>Deſcent upon <hi>Strathglaſs,</hi> and aſſaulted the Garriſon of <hi>Erchleſs,</hi> which was as I aforementioned, kept by about two hundred or leſs of the Laird of <hi>Grants</hi> Regiment, but by the induſtry, courage and zeal of their old plague Sir <hi>Thomas Levinſtone,</hi> who commanded a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable body of Horſe and Foot at <hi>Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> they were forc'd from a ſtrong Hold they were poſſeſſed of, routed, purſued and kill'd, and a conſiderable Booty of Cattel recovered, theſe Rebels or rather Robbers or both, ſeeming even from their only pretending to aſſert the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the late king, to partake by way of plague of his ill Fortune.</p>
            <p>Though many people were disſatisfi'd with the ſeveral adjournments of the Parliament from time to time from whoſe Meeting they doubted not of all the ſatisfaction they had ſo long gaped after, yet now upon the certainty of His Majeſties Reſolutions to let them ſit at the time appointed, all their fears and ſcruples vaniſhed in a moment; it being on all hands eſpecially confirm'd that his Grace the Lord Commiſſioner had full and authentick inſtructions from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64970:119"/>to redreſs all Grievances, and to ſettle the Church Government as it ſhould appear moſt ſuitable to the Will of God expreſſed in his Word, and to the inclinations and uſage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And they were much better aſſured of this when at the opening of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had freſh aſſurances of the ſame, from his Majeſties own hand, in his Royal Letter dated at <hi>Kenſington</hi> the 18th. of <hi>April,</hi> within a week after their Meeting. Wherein he aſſures them, <hi>That it ſhall be their own fault if they had not all matters of Church and State ſettled, now upon ſuch ſure and laſting Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as may render them reciprocally happy in one another during His Reign, and in all human probability, ſecure from any the like encroachments they lay under for the future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the long expected day being come, the High Commiſſioner attended by a ſplendid Train of Coaches of the Nobility and Gentry, and followed by His Majeſties Life Guards, went from the Palace of <hi>Holy Rood Houſe,</hi> about Eleven of the Clock on the Fifteenth day of <hi>April,</hi> 1690. Where after the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64970:119"/>uſual Ceremonies, His Grace deliver'd himſelf in a moſt Elegant Speech to this effect: —<hi>That though the preſſing Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of</hi> Ireland, <hi>requiring His Majeſties perſonal Expedition thither had deprived them of the happineſs of his Royal preſence as he intended, yet ſuch was his regard to the inclinations of the good Subjects of that his Ancient Kingdom, that he would no longer delay their Meeting; to the end ſuch a ſettlement might be eſtabliſhed to that Nation, as might be a real ſecurity to its moſt valuable concerns of True Religion and Juſt Liberty:</hi> He put them in mind of <hi>the great things His Majesty had done under God for the reſcuing them by the eminent danger of his own perſon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, from Popery and Slavery. That as his own Expedition and the neceſſary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence they were ſtill to make againſt the remainder of their implacable Enemies were immenſly chargeable, ſo he did not doubt now of their ready concurrence, in bearing their juſt parts in the Expence; eſpecially ſince they were aſſured that all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions would be expended for their own ſecurity. That as at his firſt coming his chief aim and deſign was to relieve them
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64970:120"/>from the oppreſſions they groaned under, ſo he would be willing to pardon all thoſe that would live peaceably and quietly in their ſeveral ſtations.</hi> He tells them at laſt, <hi>that nothing remains but that they (laying aſide all animoſities and private diſputes) unanimouſly fall on to the redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing bad, and Enacting good Laws, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the eyes of all</hi> Chriſtendom <hi>are upon them, expecting (in this juncture eſpecially) mighty things from them, that now it was fully in their own power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſureſt remedies could be thought on, for their future Peace and Happineſs, and that his moſt gracious Majeſty was ready and willing to approve them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> ſeconded the High Commiſſioner with a moſt florid and pious Speech, wherein after he had ſet forth and demonſtrated the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of God in his ſo ſignal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of them, from that deluge of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that was juſt breaking in upon them, he earneſtly preſſeth them to a ſincere reliance on the protection of their Majeſties, and to evidence a true and hearty zeal for his ſervice, but above
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64970:120"/>all he exhorts them to moderation in their diſputes, and unity in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that their Enemies may never have reaſon to ground their hopes on their diviſions. And laſtly he tell them that though they have the misfortune to be at ſome diſtance from the perſon of His Majeſty, yet that he was aſſur'd they ſhould ever find the influence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable warmth of his favours, and therefore if the reſult of their Counſels were not happy to themſelves, and of national advantage, he feared the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunity of doing well, if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, would prove a heavy charge againſt them in the day of their accounts. After the Parliament immediately fell on buſineſs, and the firſt matters of moment that they inſiſted on were the two Acts that were read and paſs'd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Seſſion of Parliament but were not touch'd, <hi>viz. The Act about the Kings Supremacy;</hi> the ſecond was <hi>the Act to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal and annul the Reſciſſory Act,</hi> which aboliſhed Presbytery, which Reſciſſory Act was made preſently after King <hi>Charles the Seconds</hi> Reſtauration, and the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion being put after ſome ſmall debate,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64970:121"/>
               <hi>Whether they ſhould be preſently Touch'd or Voted afreſh?</hi> It was carryed they ſhould be preſently touch'd, which were done accordingly.</p>
            <p>About this time happened an odd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture at <hi>Elgen</hi> about 30 miles from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs,</hi> the buſineſs thus; 4 or 5 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being in Company drinking &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king merry, among other diſcourſes they hapned to fall upon the times, and ſome of them being perſons not very well affected to the preſent Government, in the heat of their Cups did not ſtick to expreſs themſelves according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, one was in great expectation of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s ſpeedy return. Another very much doubted, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it feazible, another declar'd, he thought it impoſſible for the late King to recover or make a Conqueſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> again, at which expreſſion one <hi>Thomas Tullock</hi> was ſo much enraged, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding their diffidence with a great many reproaches, he took a Piſtol he had in his hand, and wiſh'd that that Piſtol might be his death if he (the late King <hi>James</hi>) did not return again, and be Maſter of all his own, and before he
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64970:121"/>could ſpeak a word more the Piſtol went off, and diſcharging it ſelf into his breaſt ſhot himſelf clean thorough the heart, which when related with all its circumſtances gave cauſe of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not only to his own Company but to all that heard it. The Parliament had had ſeveral warm debates of the freedom that belong'd to every of the Eſtates in Electing their ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for their Committees, and after much time on ſeveral days ſpent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; it was urged that the better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in chuſing of the ſaid Committees, it was neceſſary that the Act concerning the repealing the former Committee of Parliament, commonly called the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſhould be firſt ſent for and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; in which Act it was agreed that the Officers of State might ſit, make O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures and Propoſals, and debate in the Committee, but not to Vote; now the Houſe looking on this as a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, had heretofore in the laſt Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Voted and annulled the ſaid Act, and agreed that in lieu thereof, the Bench of Noblemen might chuſe the Officers of State, to be Members of the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64970:122"/>Committee notwithſtanding their being Miniſters of State, which being a while argu'd was at length carried by the Vote of the houſe, and approv'd of, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately had the Royal aſſent. After which the Three Eſtates proceeded to the choice of their ſeveral Committees, the Eſtate of Lords as cuſtomarily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing into the inner Seſſion houſe by themſelves. The Eſtate of Barons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Parliament houſe, and the Eſtate of Burroughs retired to the Commiſſaries Bench in the lower end of the Parliament houſe: Where after a conſiderable time they choſe their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Committees as follow.</p>

            <p>Thus the Committees being ſettled and return'd to their ſeveral places, the high Commiſſioner (according to his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) appointed them to meet the next day and ſo to adjourn from time to time in the intervals of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Rebels in the mean time though they were narrowly watched by their Majeſties Forces, had yet made a ſhift to muſter up fifteen hundred choice and ſelect men, and were come down and and encamped at the Foot of the Hills, near <hi>Straithſpey</hi> in the County of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi> commanded in chief by General <hi>Buchan,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Canon,</hi> and during their ſtay there had ſent orders wherein they reſolv'd to burn and deſtroy all that would not come out, joyn with
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64970:124"/>them and aſſiſt them; of which Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Levingſtone</hi> having timely notice, without more deliberation took along with him eight hundred Foot, ſix Troops of Dragoons and two Troops of Horſe, and with all convenient ſpeed marched towards them, and encamped that night near <hi>Brody,</hi> where he was forc'd to attend two whole days the coming of his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Horſes. On the 30th. of <hi>April</hi> he receiv'd a very good account of the Rebels Camp, numbers and poſture, and reſolving to take them napping if poſſible; he immediately Decamps and Marching all that night, he made a ſhift before the break of day to reach <hi>Ballagh</hi> Caſtle, from whence he could eaſily diſcern the Enemies Camp by their Fires, and having receiv'd a very good account of the nature of the ground and the danger of the Waters, which run along the North ſide of the Enemies Camp, and perceiving a reſolution in his Souldiers to engage, ſuitable to his own inclinations he thought fit to let them reſt for half an hour and refreſh themſelves, then enquiring about the Fords, for there were two, whereof one
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64970:125"/>lay within two Musket ſhot of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels Camp, and guarded by a ſtrong party of the Enemy; the other was near a mile up the River, and left unregarded and ſecure by the Enemy. To this he forthwith marches his Army, and in all imaginable ſilence paſſes without the leaſt oppoſition, having before left two hundred Firelocks which he had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at a convenient time to advance and fire briskly at that part of the Enemy that ſtood to ſecure the other paſs, on purpoſe to amuſe them, as if the whole Army was on that ſide coming to charge them, the project was ſo well laid, and ſo carefully executed, that our Horſe and Dragoons were upon them Pellmell before they perceived them; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſt with a pannick fear they could make little or no reſiſtance, but turn'd their backs and fled in all the confuſion imaginable. However our Horſe and Dragoons purſu'd them ſo effectually that they left above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them dead upon the ſpot, and had totally deſtroyed them and put an end to their Rebellion, if a thick Fog had not put an end to their purſuit.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64970:125"/>General <hi>Buchan</hi> and Colonel <hi>Cannon</hi> their two famous Leaders were ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily alarm'd, that the firſt was glad to fly without ſo much as Sword, Coat or Hat, and the other without more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement took his leave in his Shirt; nor had the Earl of <hi>Dumferling</hi> been better Accommodated, but that by ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental buſineſs he had removed, and was called away to ſome other quarter the day before; after our Armies return from the purſuit, Colonel <hi>Levingſtone</hi> received information that the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> General <hi>Buchan,</hi> had detach'd a ſmall party with ſeveral Officers of experience under the Command of a Kinſman of his own, and had given them Orders to poſſeſs themſelves of an old Caſtle called <hi>Lethindey:</hi> our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thought fit to have it reduced, and forthwith Leading on his men he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Beleaguered the ſame. At the firſt appearance the Garriſon ſeem'd enclined to a vigorous oppoſition, but our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander perceiving the ground proper, preſently lodg'd a Mine under the Wall, which the Enemy underſtanding they preſently beat a parley, and ſurrender'd
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64970:126"/>themſelves at diſcretion to the Kings mercy.</p>
            <p>'Tis hardly credible that in all this Action we had not one man of all our Army kill'd, and not above four or five wounded, and that but ſlightly neither, we had about half a ſcore Horſes killed; and this was all the dammage we ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in an action ſo important, we got all the Enemies Bag and Baggage, their Proviſion, and great part of it was in Claret, Meal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We took alſo the Standard which was to have been ſet up for the late King <hi>James;</hi> a great many of the Priſoners were men of note amongſt them, the chief of them were theſe.</p>

            <p>This Defeat as it is by the beſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments believ'd, has totally overthrown all the meaſures of the Rebels for this enſuing Campaign, and indeed conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering they were the choiceſt of their men, and that they are in a rank deſpair of any ſeaſonable ſupplies from <hi>Ireland.</hi> It was thought this misfortune would put them on a neceſſity of complying with the Government, and of living peaceably hereafter. The greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement they had received of late, was from the acceſs of the Earl of <hi>Seaforth</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:64970:127"/>to them who had lately come from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and made towards the North, but neither his Intereſt on one hand to raiſe either men or money, nor his perſonal ability on the other was of ſuch ſignificancy, as to encourage them to any great perſeverance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Highlanders</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> are a ſort of wretches that have no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of honour, friendſhip, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or Government, then as by any alteration of affairs, or revolution in the Government they can improve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an opportunity of Robbing and plundering their bordering Neighbours. If ther be any ſmack of religion amongſt them, 'tis generally the Roman Catholick perſwaſion, on which account any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected perſon that retired among them was ſomething likely to work to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of aſsiſting the late King <hi>James,</hi> however it ſeems the Earl of <hi>Seaforth</hi> did not meet with that encouragement and acceptance from them as he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for after many Harangues, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations he held with them upon his confident aſſurance, that the late King was preparing, nay had already ſhip'd
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64970:127"/>for their aſsiſtance of men, money pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and ammunition, together with the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> his ſon, and other brave Officers, after he had I ſay thought to decoy them with all theſe ſweetning words and fine Stories, one of the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders among the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> that had a little more ſenſe than the reſt, boldly ask'd the Earl what was become of King <hi>William</hi>'s Army and Fleet in the mean time theſe preparations were making and ſending to them; to which the Earl as fooliſhly as confidently reply'd, that King <hi>William</hi>'s Fleet were all block'd up in their Harbours by the French: an impoſition ſo groſs that the Highlanders ridicul'd and diſdain'd the impertinence, and reſented the abuſe. The Earl of <hi>Seaforth</hi> hereupon finding matters go ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coldly for King <hi>James</hi> ſoon ſaw his errour and repented his undertaking, and being willing to make the beſt of a bad market, made what interceſsion he could by his friends, to be received into the favour of the Government, but as yet the Council or Parliament have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined nothing concerning him.</p>
            <pb n="242" facs="tcp:64970:128"/>
            <p>And now the Parliament were very earneſtly applying themſelves to the ſettling of the Church Government. They had already paſſed an Act in a preceding Seſſion of this Parliament, for the aboliſhing of Prelacy, and all Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Church Officers above Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, this they did in purſuance of the claim of right at their Majeſties firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they now proceeded to an Act for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe Presbyterians, who ſince the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> one thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty one, had been thruſt from their Churches: the ſubſtance of the Act was this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That whereas many Miniſters of the Presbyterian perſwaſion ſince the year aforeſaid had been, for not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Epiſcopacy, or Prelacy, and for not complying with the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the times, either deprived of their Church, and the benefits there hence accruing, or baniſhed their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey for the ſame. Therefore their Majeſties with advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Eſtates of Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64970:128"/>ordain and appoint, that all thoſe Presbyterian Miniſters afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, or as many of them as are yet ſurviving, ſhall forthwith have free acceſs to their ſeveral reſpective Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that they may preſently here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in their ſaid Churches exerciſe their ſeveral ſpiritual functions and Offices in their ſaid Pariſhes; not needing any new call thereto: and that they ſhould enjoy and receive the whole for the year one thouſand ſix hundred and eighty nine, and ſhall forthwith enter into their ſeveral Churches where they be vacant, and where they are not vacant then they ſhall be declared to have right and title only to half the benefits and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, which became due and were payable at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, for the half year immediately preceding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Whitſunday</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and that the preſent poſſeſſour ſhall have right to the other half years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits aforementioned payable for the <hi>Witſunday</hi> laſt paſt: And by the force and authority of this Act, it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the preſent incumbent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64970:129"/>let, hindrance or oppoſition, ſhall forthwith give way to the rightful Claimants aforeſaid, and ſhall remove themſelves, and upon notice and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof ſhall deſiſt from their Miniſtry in their ſaid Pariſhes, and the time allotted for their removal ſhall be betwixt the time of the paſſing this Act, and <hi>Whitſunday</hi> next to come, that the Presbyterian Miniſters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly excluded may peaceably enter and enjoy the ſame.</q> This Act was immediately put in execution and the Presbyterians that were yet living took poſſeſſion of their ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.—</p>
            <p>This was no ſooner done but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament proceeded to conſult about a draught of an Act for the ſettlement of the Church Government, but the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Clergy, now being ſenſible what would be the conſequences of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, and what they were likely to be reduced to, form'd a Petition forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and with all convenient ſpeed had it preſented to the Parliament; wherein they humbly Remonſtrated to the 3 Eſtates, that whereas they ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64970:129"/>to the Government of their preſent Majeſties, conformable to the Law of the Land, they did humbly repreſent to and beſeech his Majeſties High Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and the three Eſtates of Parliament aſſembled, that conſidering they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready and would give aſſurance of their behaviour, according to the duty of faithful Miniſters and peaceable Subjects under the preſent eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would be pleaſed to take them into their gracious conſideration, and ſecure to them that protection as to their lives and fortunes as had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſed to them, and whereas by an Act now propoſed and likely to paſs by the application of the Presbyterian Miniſters, for the eſtabliſhment of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Church Government in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by which all Eccleſiaſtical juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and authority is ſo committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them of the ſaid Presbyterian perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that thereby thoſe ſaid perſons were made Judges of their Life and Doctrine, they humbly repreſented that this was poſitively prejudicial to that protection ſo often promiſed unto them, ſince thereby they were not only deprived of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64970:130"/>all intereſt in the Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but upon every turn made liable to the ſcrutiny and cenſure of thoſe men, (as to matter of their Life and Doctrine) who might juſtly be reputed their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies &amp; parties, &amp; conſequently incapable of being their Judges, that tho' they did not fear to ſtand the Teſt of an Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into their manners and abilities as to their function, yet they could not but look on it as an hardſhip to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adjudged by perſons whoſe inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities they offered to prove were in all points ſuperiour to what was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them, that they thought the Presbyterian brethren would not be ſo unequitable as to allow that now in their caſe, which for ſometime they diſputed and diſallow'd in theirs, to wit, as to the Presbyterians refuſing to pay ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in their Synods or Presbyters to any the Epiſcopal injunctions on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their difference in opinion from them. That they heartily griev'd there had been no Eccleſiaſtical methods us'd for the healing thoſe breaches that have been made in the Church, on the account of difference in opinion about Church
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64970:130"/>Government, that they therefore did humbly beg that that High and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court, as they reſpected the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and the advancement of his holy Religion, would take into their gracious conſideration, to prepare ſuch healing methods as may beſt in their great Wiſdoms be thought to tend toward the perfect reconciliation of thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which had ſo long diſturbed and broke the peace and unity of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church of that Kingdom: and which now was likely to be oppreſſive to the Conſciences and Intereſts of ſo many of their Majeſties loyal Subjects, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Profeſſours of the true Proteſtant Religion. This Petition was received and read in Parliament but matters as to the ſettlement of the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was too far gone, for any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary good conſequence to the Epiſcopal Clergy from it: about this time came a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which afterwards prov'd a miſtake, of the death of Sir <hi>Evan Cameron</hi> of <hi>Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heal,</hi> which was ſaid to happen in manner following; The Rebels having agreed to ſend ſome conſiderable men of their party to King <hi>James,</hi> to repreſent their
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64970:131"/>condition, and lay before him the neceſſity of ſending ſome ſpeedy ſupplies to them, or that otherwiſe they ſhould not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in a condition to hold out any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, amongſt them there aroſe a debate concerning fit perſons to be ſent, when Sir <hi>John Drummond</hi> of <hi>Machany</hi> having ſaid to <hi>Macdonald</hi> of <hi>Glengary,</hi> that they that were King <hi>James</hi> his proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites were his ruine, which <hi>Glengary</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affronted at, replyed very ſharply to him calling him ſome baſe name, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him withal he was as good a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant as he was, whereupon they both drew, and Sir <hi>Evan Cameron</hi> coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them to part and reconcile them received an unfortunate wound in the fray, which happened not to be mortal, as was reported.</p>
            <p>The Parliament after ſome debates about conſidering an Act that was brought in for Liberty of Speech, the D. of <hi>Hamilton</hi> brought in the propoſals for a Supply to be given to their Majeſties for the maintaining the Forces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at laſt they came to a reſolution, that there ſhould be a ſupply of ſeventy two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound granted to the uſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64970:131"/>and for the ſupport of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for this currant year one thouſand ſix hundred and ninety, to be paid in two equal Moyeties, and that the firſt payments ſhould be made at <hi>Lammas,</hi> the other at <hi>Martimas</hi> next enſuing. And alſo thirty thouſand pound <hi>ſterling,</hi> ſhould be aſſeſſed and raiſed for the three enſuing years, and the better to enable thoſe that are obliged this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent year, they are to have the retention of the ſixth part of their annual Rents for this preſent year; and that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ranks, qualities and degrees ſhould be obliged to pay to this Aſſeſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and none to be exempted but thoſe that received Alms. There was alſo now a motion received and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the houſe, whereby it was enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all Commiſſioners, Clerks, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers and Collectors of the ſupply granted to their preſent Majeſties, ſhould firſt be obliged to take the Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> before they could be impowred to act in their Offices. In the ſecond of <hi>June</hi> happened an accident which had
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64970:132"/>like to have proved of very fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> one <hi>Lendal</hi> Captain of the main Guard that night, perceiving one <hi>Keill</hi> a Captain of the Militia or Trained Bands of the Town, us'd him very uncivilly, giving him very opprobrious Language, and taxing him with the beggarly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of him and his Men, whereupon <hi>Keil</hi> being provok't, with a luſty Cane he had in his hand ſtruck <hi>Lendal</hi> to the ground, whereupon ſome other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officers made up, and laying hold of <hi>Kiel</hi> they preſently made him priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and carried him forthwith to the Main-Guard: <hi>Keil</hi> being a man well known and belov'd in the Town, had hundreds of the Mobile preſently reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſticks and ſtaves, and threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pull down the Guard-houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they did preſently releaſe <hi>Keil;</hi> in the mean time comes up a Magiſtrate of the town and immediately got <hi>Keil</hi> releas'd, but the Gentlemen Mobs blood being up they would not be ſatisfied without doing ſome injury to the Guard, which occaſioned the Souldiers to ſtand to their Arms, and to threaten extremity to any
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64970:132"/>that would dare to approach; all this however would not ſerve, but preſſing on with vigorous inſolence on them, the Centinels were obliged to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hapned to kill two of the daring Fellows, and wounded others, the Magiſtrates hereupon went up to the Guard, and prevailed with them to go in and keep themſelves cloſe; and in the mean time got two or three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the Earl of <hi>Levens</hi> Regiment, who were quartered in the <hi>Cannongate,</hi> to come up and immediately ſhutting the City Gates, they in a little time clear'd the ſtreets, and drove the Sparks into their Houſes without further harm, though they were obliged to keep Guards in many parts of the City, for that Night for fear of a relapſe. The Captains are both of them confin'd, and 'tis believed he that gave the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation will be ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Pearth</hi> had been long a Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>ſterling,</hi> for his high miſdemeanours in the laſt Reign, together for his diſaffection to the preſent eſtabliſhment and but now by the repreſentation of the Earl of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64970:133"/>
               <hi>Crawford</hi> it was mediated that he might have his liberty, provided he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the coming back and ſafe return of the young Lord <hi>Drummond</hi> his Son, the Earl of <hi>Wigtown</hi> and his brother, who during the Guardianſhip of him the ſaid Earl of <hi>Pearth,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Melfort,</hi> were ſent over Seas by their eſpecial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, on purpoſe to be bred up in the Romiſh ſuperſtition, and that the Earl of <hi>Pearth</hi> ſhould give allowable ſecurity to do ſo, as alſo for his peaceable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, without plotting or conſpiring againſt the preſent Government.

            <p>Thus after ſo much diſorder, ſo much Tyranny and Oppreſſion in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the ill ſucceſſes of Rebellion, and the Return of Law and Juſtice into their ancient Channel, one would think ſhould be ſufficient to regain the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men wandring after Chimera's, and unite them to a Prince who has laid ſuch Foundations of their Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But Rebels and Robbers very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom liſſen to theſe charms, let the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer charm never ſo wiſely. Which is the reaſon that the remains of Rebellion cannot yet be extinguiſh'd; and that their are ſeveral Trayterous Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Correſpondencies found out of ſuch as make it their buſineſs to diſturb
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64970:137"/>the peace of the Government. However in regard thoſe Diſcoveries are not yet ripe for publick view, and that we can ſay nothing more of the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> but that they Rob and plunder where they can find any advantage, it is time here to conclude this accompt of the Revolution in <hi>Scotland,</hi> no leſs memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then that in <hi>England.</hi>
